# Put Away Tasks UI Implementation

## Overview
Complete implementation of the Put Away Tasks UI following the existing patterns from PickLists and other Store pages.

## Files Created

### Main Page
- `PutAwayTasks/PutAwayTasks.razor` - Main put-away tasks list with advanced search
- `PutAwayTasks/PutAwayTasks.razor.cs` - Page logic with workflow operations

### Dialogs
- `PutAwayTasks/PutAwayTaskDetailsDialog.razor` - View task details and items
- `PutAwayTasks/PutAwayTaskDetailsDialog.razor.cs` - Details dialog logic
- `PutAwayTasks/AssignPutAwayTaskDialog.razor` - Assign task to worker
- `PutAwayTasks/AssignPutAwayTaskDialog.razor.cs` - Assignment dialog logic  
- `PutAwayTasks/AddPutAwayTaskItemDialog.razor` - Add items to task
- `PutAwayTasks/AddPutAwayTaskItemDialog.razor.cs` - Add item dialog logic

## Features Implemented

### Advanced Search Filters
- Warehouse selection
- Status filter (Created, Assigned, InProgress, Completed, Cancelled)
- Put-Away Strategy filter (FIFO, LIFO, NearestLocation, Directed)
- Assigned worker filter
- Priority range (min/max)
- Start date range

### Workflow Operations
1. **View Details** - View complete task information including items
2. **Assign to Worker** - Assign task to warehouse worker (status: Created)
3. **Start Put Away** - Begin put-away operations (status: Assigned)
4. **Complete Put Away** - Finalize task (status: InProgress)

### Task Management
- Create new put-away tasks
- Add items to tasks with:
  - Item selection
  - Destination bin selection
  - Quantity to put away
  - Sequence number for operation order
  - Optional notes
- Progress tracking (completion percentage)
- Delete tasks

## Code Patterns Followed

### CQRS Pattern
- Commands: `CreatePutAwayTaskCommand`, `AssignPutAwayTaskCommand`, `StartPutAwayCommand`, `CompletePutAwayCommand`, `AddPutAwayTaskItemCommand`
- Queries: `SearchPutAwayTasksCommand`, `GetPutAwayTaskQuery`

### DRY Principle
- Reusable components: `AutocompleteWarehouse`, `AutocompleteItem`, `AutocompleteBin`
- Consistent dialog patterns across all Store modules
- Shared EntityTable component for CRUD operations

### Documentation
- XML documentation on all classes, methods, and properties
- Inline comments explaining complex logic
- Clear parameter descriptions

### Validation
- Required field validation
- Min/max value constraints
- String length limits with counters
- Business rule validation (e.g., quantity > 0)

## Menu Integration

Updated `MenuService.cs` to change Put Away Tasks status from `ComingSoon` to `InProgress`:

```csharp
new MenuSectionSubItemModel { 
    Title = "Put Away Tasks", 
    Icon = Icons.Material.Filled.AddToQueue, 
    Href = "/store/put-away-tasks", 
    Action = FshActions.View, 
    Resource = FshResources.Store, 
    PageStatus = PageStatus.InProgress 
}
```

## Status Colors

### Task Status
- Created → Default (Grey)
- Assigned → Info (Blue)
- InProgress → Warning (Orange)
- Completed → Success (Green)
- Cancelled → Error (Red)

### Item Status
- Pending → Default (Grey)
- PutAway → Success (Green)
- Partial → Warning (Orange)

## Known Build Issues

The current build shows errors because the API client needs to be regenerated to include the new endpoints:

```bash
# Regenerate the API client (from the api/server directory)
dotnet build
# This will update the OpenAPI specification

# Then regenerate the Blazor client
cd apps/blazor/infrastructure/Api
# Run the NSwag code generation tool
```

### Missing API Client Methods
The following methods need to be generated in the API client:
- `GetPutAwayTaskEndpointAsync`
- `StartPutAwayEndpointAsync`
- `CompletePutAwayEndpointAsync`
- `AddPutAwayTaskItemEndpointAsync`

These methods correspond to existing backend endpoints in `PutAwayTasksEndpoints.cs`.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] List put-away tasks with pagination
- [ ] Search tasks by keyword
- [ ] Filter by warehouse, status, strategy
- [ ] Create new put-away task
- [ ] View task details
- [ ] Add items to task
- [ ] Assign task to worker
- [ ] Start put-away operation
- [ ] Complete put-away operation
- [ ] Delete task
- [ ] Progress tracking displays correctly
- [ ] All validations work properly
