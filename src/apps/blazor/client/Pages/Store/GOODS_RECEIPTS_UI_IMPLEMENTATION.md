## UI Patterns Followed

### ✅ Consistency with Existing Code
- **EntityTable pattern** - Used for main listing page
- **Dialog pattern** - All dialogs follow MudDialog structure
- **Autocomplete pattern** - Product autocomplete matches existing Store autocompletes
- **Code organization** - Separate .razor and .razor.cs files
- **Naming conventions** - Consistent with PurchaseOrders and other modules
- **Service injection** - Uses existing Client, Snackbar, DialogService
- **Navigation** - Integrates with existing routing

### ✅ MudBlazor Components Used
- MudTable (with sorting, filtering, pagination)
- MudDialog (for all modal interactions)
- MudForm (with validation)
- MudTextField, MudNumericField, MudDatePicker
- MudSelect, MudCheckBox
- MudButton, MudIconButton
- MudChip (for status display)
- MudProgressLinear (for completion tracking)
- MudAlert (for informational messages)
- MudDivider (for visual separation)
- AutocompleteWarehouse, AutocompleteProduct (custom)

## Integration with Backend

### API Endpoints Used
1. **Goods Receipts**
   - `SearchGoodsReceiptsEndpoint` - List/filter receipts
   - `GetGoodsReceiptEndpoint` - Get single receipt with items
   - `CreateGoodsReceiptEndpoint` - Create new receipt
   - `DeleteGoodsReceiptEndpoint` - Delete draft receipt
   - `AddGoodsReceiptItemEndpoint` - Add item to receipt

2. **Purchase Orders**
   - `SearchPurchaseOrdersEndpoint` - List POs for selection
   - `GetPurchaseOrderEndpoint` - Get PO details
   - `SearchPurchaseOrderItemsEndpoint` - Get PO line items

3. **Supporting Data**
   - `SearchWarehousesEndpoint` - Warehouse lookup
   - `SearchSuppliersEndpoint` - Supplier lookup
   - `SearchProductsEndpoint` - Product search (via autocomplete)

### Notes on API
- Some endpoints referenced in implementation docs may not be fully available yet:
  - `MarkReceivedEndpoint` - Placeholder added with warning message
  - `CancelGoodsReceiptEndpoint` - Placeholder added with warning message
  - `RemoveGoodsReceiptItemEndpoint` - Noted as needing implementation
- The current AddGoodsReceiptItemCommand uses simplified schema (ItemId instead of ProductId)
- Extended properties (lot numbers, serial numbers, quality fields) are captured in UI but may need API updates

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create a new goods receipt manually
- [ ] Add items to the receipt
- [ ] Mark receipt as received
- [ ] Create receipt from purchase order
- [ ] Select multiple PO items with different quantities
- [ ] Verify remaining quantities update correctly
- [ ] Create second receipt for same PO (partial receiving)
- [ ] View receiving history for a PO
- [ ] Verify progress bars show correct percentages
- [ ] Cancel a draft receipt
- [ ] Search/filter receipts by various criteria
- [ ] Verify all dialogs open and close properly

   - Remove Item from Receipt
   
2. **Extended Properties:**
   - Lot numbers, serial numbers, expiry dates, and quality fields are captured in UI
   - API command currently only accepts: ItemId, Quantity, UnitCost, PurchaseOrderItemId
   - Full property support requires API updates per implementation docs

3. **Warehouse Location:**
