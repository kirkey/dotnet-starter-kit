## Architecture Patterns Followed

### ✅ Consistency with Existing Code
- **EntityTable Pattern**: Uses EntityServerTableContext like other pages
- **Dialog Pattern**: All dialogs follow MudDialog structure
- **Code Organization**: Separate .razor and .razor.cs files
- **Naming Conventions**: Consistent with PurchaseOrders and GoodsReceipts
- **Service Injection**: Uses Client, Snackbar, DialogService
- **Navigation**: Integrates with existing routing

### ✅ CQRS Command/Request Patterns
- ✅ `SearchCycleCountsCommand` for filtering
- ✅ `CreateCycleCountCommand` for creation
- ✅ `UpdateCycleCountCommand` for updates
- ✅ `CancelCycleCountCommand` with reason
- ✅ `StartCycleCountEndpoint` for workflow
- ✅ `CompleteCycleCountEndpoint` for workflow
- ✅ `ReconcileCycleCountEndpoint` for workflow
- ✅ `AddCycleCountItemCommand` for items
- ✅ `RecordCycleCountItemCommand` for counting

### ✅ MudBlazor Components Used
- MudTable (main listing and details)
- MudDialog (all modal interactions)
- MudForm (with validation)
- MudTextField, MudNumericField, MudDatePicker, MudSelect
- MudChip (for status display)
- MudProgressLinear (for completion tracking)
- MudAlert (for warnings and info)
- MudSimpleTable (for detail views)
- MudDivider (for visual separation)
- MudButton, MudIconButton
- AutocompleteWarehouse, AutocompleteItem (custom)

## Workflow Support

### Workflow 1: Create and Start Count
```
1. Click "Add" → Fill form → Save as Scheduled
2. View Details → Add items to count
3. Start Count → Status changes to InProgress
4. Record counts for each item
5. Complete Count → Status changes to Completed
```

### Workflow 2: Record Counts with Variance Tracking
```
1. Open InProgress count
2. Click Edit icon on each item
3. Enter counted quantity
4. System calculates variance automatically
5. Add notes if significant variance
6. System suggests recount for large variances
7. Save count
```

### Workflow 3: Reconcile Variances
```
1. Complete count (all items counted)
2. Review variances in Completed count
3. Click "Reconcile Variances"
4. System adjusts inventory to match counted quantities
5. Audit trail maintained
```

### Workflow 4: Cancel Count
```
1. Select Scheduled or InProgress count
2. Click "Cancel Count" from context menu
3. Confirm cancellation
4. Status changes to Cancelled
```

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used
1. `SearchCycleCountsEndpoint` - List/filter counts
2. `GetCycleCountEndpoint` - Get single count with items
3. `CreateCycleCountEndpoint` - Create new count
4. `UpdateCycleCountEndpoint` - Update count details
5. `StartCycleCountEndpoint` - Start counting workflow
6. `CompleteCycleCountEndpoint` - Finalize count
7. `CancelCycleCountEndpoint` - Cancel count with reason
8. `ReconcileCycleCountEndpoint` - Adjust inventory
9. `AddCycleCountItemEndpoint` - Add item to count
10. `RecordCycleCountItemEndpoint` - Record counted quantity

### Command/Request Structure

3. **Export to Excel**: Export count results
4. **Historical Comparison**: Compare with previous counts
5. **ABC Analysis**: Automated count frequency based on value
6. **Photo Capture**: Attach photos during counting
7. **Voice Input**: Voice-to-text for counts
8. **Offline Mode**: Count without internet, sync later
