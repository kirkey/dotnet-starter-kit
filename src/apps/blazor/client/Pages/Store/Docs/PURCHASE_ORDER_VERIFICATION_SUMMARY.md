## 8. Architecture Patterns Followed

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- ✅ Commands for mutations (Create, Update, Delete, Submit, Approve, etc.)
- ✅ Queries for reads (Get, Search)
- ✅ Separate handlers for each operation
- ✅ Clear responsibility separation

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- ✅ Reusable specifications
- ✅ Generic EntityTable component
- ✅ Shared autocomplete components
- ✅ Base handler classes
- ✅ Common validation patterns

### Domain-Driven Design
- ✅ Rich domain entities with behavior
- ✅ Aggregate root pattern (PurchaseOrder → PurchaseOrderItems)
- ✅ Value objects (Status strings)
- ✅ Domain events (for future implementation)
- ✅ Specification pattern for queries

### Clean Architecture
- ✅ Domain at the center (no dependencies)
- ✅ Application layer uses domain abstractions
- ✅ Infrastructure implements interfaces
- ✅ UI depends only on application contracts
- ✅ Dependency inversion throughout
