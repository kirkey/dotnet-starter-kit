## Warehouse Pages Status
1. **Warehouses** - Exists, needs verification
2. **WarehouseLocations** - Exists, needs verification

## Key Patterns Followed
- EntityServerTableContext for consistent table setup
- EntityTable component with Context property
- Autocomplete components for foreign keys
- Adapt<> for mapping between ViewModels and Commands
- Consistent field naming and structure
- getDetailsFunc for edit operations
- searchFunc, createFunc, updateFunc, deleteFunc for all operations

## Autocomplete Components Available
- AutocompleteCategoryId (nullable)
- AutocompleteItem (non-nullable)
- AutocompleteSupplier (nullable)
- AutocompleteWarehouseId (non-nullable)

## Next Steps
1. Complete ItemSuppliers.razor.cs
2. Create StockLevels page with special operations
3. Create InventoryReservations page
4. Create remaining workflow-heavy pages
5. Verify and update Warehouse pages
6. Final build and error resolution
