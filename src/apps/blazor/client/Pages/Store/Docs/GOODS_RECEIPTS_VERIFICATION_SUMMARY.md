## 9. Architecture Patterns Followed

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- ✅ Commands for mutations (Create, Delete, MarkReceived, AddItem)
- ✅ Queries for reads (Get, Search, GetPOItemsForReceiving)
- ✅ Separate handlers for each operation
- ✅ Clear responsibility separation

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- ✅ Reusable specifications
- ✅ Generic EntityTable component
- ✅ Shared autocomplete components
- ✅ Base handler classes
- ✅ Common validation patterns
- ✅ Reusable dialog components

### Domain-Driven Design
- ✅ Rich domain entities with behavior
- ✅ Aggregate root pattern (GoodsReceipt → GoodsReceiptItems)
- ✅ Value objects (Status strings)
- ✅ Domain events (GoodsReceiptCreated, GoodsReceiptCompleted)
- ✅ Specification pattern for queries

### Clean Architecture
- ✅ Domain at the center (no dependencies)
- ✅ Application layer uses domain abstractions
- ✅ Infrastructure implements interfaces
- ✅ UI depends only on application contracts
- ✅ Dependency inversion throughout

## 11. Known Limitations and Future Enhancements

### Current State
- ✅ All core functionality implemented
- ✅ Full partial receiving support
- ✅ Quality control fields captured
- ✅ Search and filtering operational
- ✅ Receiving history tracking complete

### Notes on Extended Properties
The UI captures comprehensive quality control fields:
- Lot Numbers
- Serial Numbers
- Expiry Dates
- Quality Status (Pending, Passed, Failed, Quarantined)
- Inspector Name
- Inspection Date
- Rejected Quantities
- Variance Reasons

**Current API Limitation**: The AddGoodsReceiptItemCommand currently accepts:
- ItemId
- Quantity
- UnitCost
- PurchaseOrderItemId (optional)

**Future Enhancement Needed**: Extend AddGoodsReceiptItemCommand to include all quality control fields captured in the UI.

### Potential Future Enhancements
1. **Remove Item Endpoint**: Add DELETE endpoint for removing items from receipts
2. **Cancel Receipt Endpoint**: Add POST endpoint for canceling receipts with reason
3. **Barcode Scanning**: Mobile-friendly receiving with barcode scanners
4. **Photo Capture**: Attach photos for damaged goods or quality issues
5. **Receipt Printing**: Generate receipt labels and packing slips
6. **Batch Receiving**: Receive multiple POs in one session
7. **Advanced Reporting**: Receiving efficiency dashboard
8. **Email Notifications**: Notify stakeholders when receipts are received
9. **Quality Inspection Workflow**: Separate inspection step with hold/release
10. **Return to Supplier**: Handle rejected goods and return processes
