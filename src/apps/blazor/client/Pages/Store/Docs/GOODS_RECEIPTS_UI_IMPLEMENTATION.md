- ✅ `AddGoodsReceiptItemCommand` for items
- ✅ `MarkReceivedCommand` for workflow
- ✅ `GetPurchaseOrderItemsForReceivingEndpoint` for partial receiving
- ✅ Integration with Purchase Orders module

### ✅ MudBlazor Components Used
- MudTable (main listing and items)
- MudDialog (all modal interactions)
- MudForm (with validation)
- MudTextField, MudNumericField, MudDatePicker, MudSelect
- MudCheckBox (item selection in wizard)
- MudProgressLinear (receiving progress)
- MudChip (status indicators)
- MudSimpleTable (detail views)
- MudDivider (visual separation)

## Status Colors and Workflow

### Status Definitions

Received   → Items received, inventory updated, locked
Cancelled  → Receipt cancelled, no inventory impact
Posted     → Receipt posted to accounting (future state)
```

```
Draft → Received (via Mark Received)
Draft → Cancelled (via Cancel/Delete)
```

### Action Availability Matrix
```
Status     | View | Mark Received | Add Item | Remove Item | Delete | Cancel
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Draft      |  ✅  |      ✅       |    ✅    |     ✅      |   ✅   |   ✅
Received   |  ✅  |      ❌       |    ❌    |     ❌      |   ❌   |   ❌
Cancelled  |  ✅  |      ❌       |    ❌    |     ❌      |   ❌   |   ❌
Posted     |  ✅  |      ❌       |    ❌    |     ❌      |   ❌   |   ❌
```

## Partial Receiving Details

### How It Works
1. Purchase Order status: Sent (all items unrecv)
2. Create Receipt 1 from PO
3. Select items to receive (e.g., 50% of quantities)
4. Mark Receipt 1 as Received
5. PO status → Partially Received
6. PO items show Received vs Ordered
7. Create Receipt 2 from PO
8. Remaining items available for selection
9. Receive remaining items
10. Mark Receipt 2 as Received
11. PO status → Received (fully received)

### Benefits
- **Flexibility**: Receive shipments as they arrive
- **Accuracy**: Track exactly what was received when
- **Visibility**: Clear progress tracking
- **Quality**: Inspect and receive in stages
- **Planning**: Know what's still expected

### Tracking Mechanism
- **Per Item**: Ordered, Received, Remaining quantities
- **Per Receipt**: Which items, how many, when
- **Per PO**: Overall progress, percentage complete
- **History**: All receipts viewable in one place

---

## Quality Control Features

### Quality Status Options
```
Pending   → Initial state, awaiting inspection
Approved  → Passed quality check, available for use
Rejected  → Failed quality check, cannot be used
OnHold    → Held for additional review
```

### Quality Data Captured
- Inspector name (who inspected)
- Inspection date (when inspected)
- Quality status (pass/fail/hold)
- Variance reason (if quantity differs)
- Notes (additional details)

### Lot and Serial Tracking
- **Lot Numbers**: Batch tracking for groups of items
- **Serial Numbers**: Individual item tracking
- **Expiry Dates**: Perishable item tracking
- **Use Cases**: Recalls, warranty, compliance

## Best Practices

### Receiving Process
1. **Use Create from PO** - Link receipts to POs for tracking
2. **Inspect before marking received** - Add quality control info
3. **Track lot/serial numbers** - For traceability
4. **Document variances** - Add reasons for quantity differences
5. **Receive in stages** - Use partial receiving for large orders

### Quality Control
1. **Set quality status** for all items
2. **Enter inspector name** for accountability
3. **Add expiry dates** for perishable items
4. **Track rejections** to monitor supplier quality
5. **Document issues** in notes field

### Partial Receiving
1. **Create first receipt** as items arrive
2. **Mark received immediately** to update inventory
3. **Check PO status** to see what's still expected
4. **Create additional receipts** as more items arrive
5. **Monitor progress** via receiving history
