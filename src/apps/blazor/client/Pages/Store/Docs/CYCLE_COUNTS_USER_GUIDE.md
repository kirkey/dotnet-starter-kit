## Count Details View

### Header Information
- Count Number and Status
- Warehouse and Location (if applicable)
- Count Type and Scheduled Date
- Start Date and Completion Date (when available)
- Counter Name
- Progress: X / Y items counted (with progress bar)
- Variance count
- Description and Notes

### Items Table
Shows all items in the count with:
- **Item Name**: Product being counted
- **System Qty**: Expected quantity from inventory
- **Counted Qty**: Actual physical count
- **Variance**: Difference (System - Counted)
  - üü¢ Green = Match (0 variance)
  - üî¥ Red = Difference (shows amount)
- **Recount**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning icon if significant variance
- **Actions**: Edit button to record/update count (InProgress only)

---

## Variance Tracking

### Variance Calculation
```
Variance = Counted Quantity - System Quantity

Examples:
System: 100, Counted: 100 ‚Üí Variance: 0 (Perfect match) üü¢
System: 100, Counted: 105 ‚Üí Variance: +5 (Overage) üî¥
System: 100, Counted: 95  ‚Üí Variance: -5 (Shortage) üî¥
```

### Variance Alerts
- **Success** (Green): No variance - perfect match
- **Info** (Blue): Small variance (< 5 units)
- **Warning** (Orange): Moderate variance (5-9 units)
- **Error** (Red): Significant variance (‚â• 10 units)

### Recount Recommendations
When recording a count with variance ‚â• 10 units, the system will:
1. Display a warning message
2. Suggest performing a recount
3. Allow you to add notes explaining the variance

---

## Best Practices

### Planning
1. **Schedule counts** during low-activity periods
2. **Use ABC analysis** to prioritize high-value items
3. **Assign specific counters** for accountability
4. **Plan by location** for efficient physical counting

### Counting
1. **Count physically first** before looking at system quantity
2. **Record immediately** to avoid forgetting
3. **Add notes** for any variances
4. **Recount** items with significant variances
5. **Take photos** of discrepancies (if needed)

### Reconciliation
1. **Review all variances** before reconciling
2. **Investigate** significant differences
3. **Document reasons** for variances
4. **Train staff** on proper counting procedures
5. **Monitor trends** to identify recurring issues

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Full Warehouse Count
```
1. Create count (Type: Full)
2. Add all items in the warehouse
3. Assign to counter
4. Start count
5. Counter records all quantities
6. Complete count
7. Review variances
8. Reconcile to adjust inventory
```

### Scenario 2: ABC Cycle Count
```
1. Create count (Type: ABC)
2. Add high-value A items only
3. Schedule for weekly
4. Start count on schedule
5. Record counts carefully
6. Complete and reconcile
7. Repeat weekly
```

### Scenario 3: Random Spot Check
```
1. Create count (Type: Random)
2. Add 10-20 random items
3. Start count immediately
4. Quick physical count
5. Record findings
6. Complete count
7. Review variances
8. Investigate any issues
```

### Scenario 4: Investigating Variances
```
1. Complete count shows variances
2. View details to see which items
3. Items with large variances:
   - Don't reconcile yet
   - Cancel the count
   - Create new count for problem items
   - Recount carefully
   - Investigate causes (theft, damage, errors)
4. Once satisfied, reconcile
```

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Start Count
- **Cause**: Count must be in Scheduled status
- **Solution**: Check status, create new count if needed

### Can't Add Items
- **Cause**: Count must be Scheduled or InProgress
- **Solution**: Check status, start count if scheduled

### Can't Record Counts
- **Cause**: Count must be InProgress
- **Solution**: Start the count first

### Can't See Reconcile Option
- **Cause**: Count must be Completed with variances > 0
- **Solution**: Complete the count first, check if variances exist

### Item Not in Dropdown
- **Cause**: Item not active or not found
- **Solution**: Check Items page, ensure item is active

## Keyboard Shortcuts

While in dialogs:

- **Tab**: Navigate between fields

---

## Tips & Tricks

### Efficiency
- Use **Advanced Search** to quickly find counts by warehouse
- **Sort by Count Date** to see upcoming counts
- **Filter by Status** to focus on InProgress counts
- Keep the **Details dialog open** while counting to quickly update items

### Accuracy
- Always **record the physical count first** before looking at system quantity
- **Count twice** for high-value items
- **Take breaks** during long counts to maintain accuracy
- **Use Notes field** to document unusual situations

### Organization
- Use **consistent naming** for count numbers (e.g., CC-YYYY-NNN)
- **Document your process** in the Description field
- **Assign specific counters** for accountability
- **Track completion time** to estimate future counts
