**Date**: October 25, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## What Was Updated

### File Modified
**File**: `/apps/blazor/client/Services/Navigation/MenuService.cs`

### Change Made
Updated the **Cycle Counts** menu item in the Warehouse section to point to the correct route.

**Before**:
```csharp
new MenuSectionSubItemModel { 
    Title = "Cycle Counts", 
    Icon = Icons.Material.Filled.Checklist, 
    Href = "/warehouse/cycle-counts",  // ❌ Wrong route
    Action = FshActions.View, 
    Resource = FshResources.Store, 
    PageStatus = PageStatus.InProgress 
}
```

**After**:
```csharp
new MenuSectionSubItemModel { 
    Title = "Cycle Counts", 
    Icon = Icons.Material.Filled.Checklist, 
    Href = "/store/cycle-counts",  // ✅ Correct route
    Action = FshActions.View, 
    Resource = FshResources.Store, 
    PageStatus = PageStatus.InProgress 
}
```

---

## Navigation Structure

The Cycle Counts menu item is now properly configured in the navigation menu:

### Location in Menu
```
Modules
  └── Warehouse
      ├── Warehouses
      ├── Warehouse Locations
      ├── Cycle Counts ← ✅ Updated
      ├── Pick Lists
      └── Put Away Tasks
```

### Menu Item Properties
- **Title**: Cycle Counts
- **Icon**: Icons.Material.Filled.Checklist (✅ checklist icon)
- **Route**: `/store/cycle-counts`
- **Action**: View
- **Resource**: Store
- **Status**: InProgress (shows "In Development" badge)

---

## How It Appears in UI

When users navigate the menu, they will see:

```
📦 Modules
  └── 📦 Warehouse
      ├── 🏭 Warehouses
      ├── 📍 Warehouse Locations
      ├── ✅ Cycle Counts
      │   └── 🐛 In Development (badge)
      ├── 📋 Pick Lists (Coming Soon)
      └── ➕ Put Away Tasks (Coming Soon)
```

---

## Access Control

### Required Permission
- **Action**: `View`
- **Resource**: `Store`

Users must have the `View` permission for the `Store` resource to see and access the Cycle Counts menu item.

### Status Badge
The menu item displays an **"In Development"** badge with:
- 🐛 Bug icon
- Orange color
- Tooltip: "Feature in development - may contain bugs"

This indicates to users that the feature is complete but may still have some issues being resolved.

---

## Route Mapping

The menu item links to:
- **Route**: `/store/cycle-counts`
- **Component**: `CycleCounts.razor`
- **Location**: `/apps/blazor/client/Pages/Store/CycleCounts.razor`

This matches the `@page` directive in the Razor component:
```razor
@page "/store/cycle-counts"
```

---

## Testing the Navigation

### How to Test
1. **Start the application**
2. **Login** with a user that has Store permissions
3. **Navigate** to the menu: Modules → Warehouse
4. **Click** on "Cycle Counts"
5. **Verify** the page loads correctly at `/store/cycle-counts`

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Menu item is visible
- ✅ Shows "In Development" badge
- ✅ Clicking navigates to Cycle Counts page
- ✅ Page displays with EntityTable
- ✅ All CRUD operations work
- ✅ Workflow actions available

---

## Status Summary

- [x] Route correctly mapped
- [x] Icon assigned (Checklist)

## Next Steps

### To Change Status from "InProgress" to "Completed"

When the feature is fully tested and ready for production, update the menu item:

```csharp
// Remove the PageStatus property or set to null
new MenuSectionSubItemModel { 
    Title = "Cycle Counts", 
    Icon = Icons.Material.Filled.Checklist, 
    Href = "/store/cycle-counts",
    Action = FshActions.View, 
    Resource = FshResources.Store
    // PageStatus = PageStatus.InProgress  ← Remove this line
}
```

This will remove the "In Development" badge and show the menu item as stable.

---

## Additional Notes

### Other "InProgress" Store Pages
The following Store pages are also marked as "InProgress":
- Dashboard
- Bins
- Suppliers
- Item Suppliers
- Purchase Orders
- Goods Receipts

### Future Menu Organization
Consider organizing the menu items by functional area:
1. **Setup & Master Data** (Categories, Items, Suppliers, etc.)
2. **Procurement** (Purchase Orders, Goods Receipts)
3. **Inventory** (Stock Levels, Adjustments, Transactions)
4. **Warehouse Operations** (Cycle Counts, Pick Lists, Put Away)
5. **Tracking** (Lot Numbers, Serial Numbers)

This would improve discoverability and user experience.

## Conclusion

✅ **Navigation menu successfully updated!**

The Cycle Counts feature is now accessible via:
- **Path**: Modules → Warehouse → Cycle Counts
- **URL**: `/store/cycle-counts`
- **Status**: In Development (InProgress badge)

Users with the appropriate Store permissions can now navigate to and use the Cycle Counts feature through the main application menu.
