### ✅ CQRS Command/Request Patterns
- ✅ `SearchPurchaseOrdersCommand` for filtering
- ✅ `CreatePurchaseOrderCommand` for creation
- ✅ `UpdatePurchaseOrderCommand` for updates
- ✅ `SubmitPurchaseOrderRequest` for workflow
- ✅ `ApprovePurchaseOrderRequest` for workflow
- ✅ `SendPurchaseOrderRequest` for workflow
- ✅ `ReceivePurchaseOrderRequest` for workflow
- ✅ `CancelPurchaseOrderRequest` for workflow
- ✅ `AddPurchaseOrderItemCommand` for items
- ✅ `UpdatePurchaseOrderItemQuantityCommand` for items

### ✅ MudBlazor Components Used
- MudTable (main listing and items)
- MudDialog (all modal interactions)
- MudForm (with validation)
- MudTextField, MudNumericField, MudDatePicker, MudSelect
- MudChip (for urgent indicator)
- MudSimpleTable (for detail views)
- MudDivider (for visual separation)
- MudButton, MudIconButton
- MudProgressCircular (loading states)
- AutocompleteSupplier, AutocompleteItem (custom)
