# Inventory Reservations UI Implementation

## Overview
Complete Blazor UI implementation for the Inventory Reservations feature, enabling users to create, view, search, and release inventory reservations to prevent overselling and support order fulfillment workflows.

## Files Created/Updated

### Main Page (2 files)
1. **InventoryReservations.razor** - Main page with advanced search, create/edit form, and actions
2. **InventoryReservations.razor.cs** - Page logic with CRUD operations and business logic

### Dialog Components (4 files)
3. **ReservationDetailsDialog.razor** - Dialog for viewing detailed reservation information
4. **ReservationDetailsDialog.razor.cs** - Dialog logic for loading and displaying details
5. **ReleaseReservationDialog.razor** - Dialog for releasing active reservations
6. **ReleaseReservationDialog.razor.cs** - Dialog logic for the release operation

## Features Implemented

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Integration
- Uses generated `IClient` API client from NSwag
- API Version: "1"
- Endpoints used:
  - `SearchInventoryReservationsEndpointAsync` - Search with filters
  - `CreateInventoryReservationEndpointAsync` - Create new reservation
  - `GetInventoryReservationEndpointAsync` - Get details by ID
  - `ReleaseInventoryReservationEndpointAsync` - Release reservation
  - `DeleteInventoryReservationEndpointAsync` - Delete reservation

### Data Models
- **InventoryReservationResponse** - API response type
  - Id, ReservationNumber, ItemId, ItemName, WarehouseId, WarehouseName
  - ReservedQuantity (decimal), ReservationDate, ExpirationDate
  - Status, ReferenceType, ReferenceId, Notes, Name, Description
- **InventoryReservationViewModel** - Form model (extends CreateInventoryReservationCommand)
  - Includes additional Id, Status, and ReservationDate for display
- **CreateInventoryReservationCommand** - Create operation
- **ReleaseInventoryReservationCommand** - Release operation with Id and Reason

### Component Architecture
- Follows existing patterns from CycleCounts and PurchaseOrders implementations
- Uses `EntityTable` and `EntityServerTableContext` for grid functionality
- Leverages MudBlazor components throughout
- Injects dependencies via `_Imports.razor`: Client, Snackbar, DialogService
- Uses `IMudDialogInstance` for dialog management

### Search Implementation
Maps UI filter properties to `SearchInventoryReservationsCommand`:
```csharp
var command = new SearchInventoryReservationsCommand
{
    PageNumber, PageSize, Keyword, OrderBy,
    ItemId, WarehouseId, Status, ReservationType,
    ReservationDateFrom, ReservationDateTo,
    IsExpired, IsActive
};
```

### Expiration Logic
- `IsExpired()` helper method checks if expiration date is past
- Used in:
  - ExtraActions to conditionally show Release button
  - Details dialog to display expired indicator
  - Both main page and dialogs use consistent logic

## User Workflows

### Create New Reservation
1. Click "Add Inventory Reservation" button
2. Fill required fields: Reservation Number, Item, Warehouse, Quantity, Type
3. Optionally set expiration date and other fields
4. Click Save
5. Grid refreshes with new reservation

### View Reservation Details
1. Click "..." menu on any row
2. Select "View Details"
3. Dialog opens showing all reservation information
4. Review details organized in logical sections
5. Click "Close" to return to grid

### Release Active Reservation
1. Click "..." menu on an Active, non-expired row
2. Select "Release Reservation"
3. Dialog shows reservation summary
4. Enter required release reason (up to 500 chars)
5. Click "Release Reservation"
6. API processes release, returning quantity to available stock
7. Grid refreshes showing updated status

### Search & Filter
1. Click "Advanced Search" toggle
2. Select desired filters (Item, Warehouse, Status, Type, Dates)
3. Use toggle switches for Expired/Active filters
4. Grid automatically updates with filtered results
5. Clear filters to show all reservations

## Business Rules

### Creation Rules
- Reservation Number must be unique
- Quantity must be positive integer
- Expiration Date (if set) must be in the future
- Reservation Type must be one of: Order, Transfer, Production, Assembly, Other

### Release Rules
- Can only release reservations with Status = "Active"
- Cannot release expired reservations
- Release Reason is mandatory (max 500 characters)
- Releasing returns quantity to available stock
- Status changes to "Released" after successful release

### Status Transitions
- **Active** → Released (via Release action)
- **Active** → Allocated (via backend pick list operations)
- **Active** → Cancelled (via backend cancellation)
- **Active** → Expired (via backend expiration process)
- Once Released, Allocated, Cancelled, or Expired, status cannot change

## Integration Points

### Autocomplete Components Used
- **AutocompleteItem** - For item selection
- **AutocompleteWarehouse** - For warehouse selection

### Dropdown Data Loading
- Items loaded via `SearchItemsEndpointAsync` (500 max, ordered by Name)
- Warehouses loaded via `SearchWarehousesEndpointAsync` (500 max, ordered by Name)
- Both loaded on page initialization

### Permission Requirements
Based on `FshResources.Store`:
- View/Search: `Permissions.Store.View`
- Create: `Permissions.Store.Create`
- Delete: `Permissions.Store.Delete`
- Release (Update): `Permissions.Store.Update`

## Styling & UX

### Responsive Layout
- Grid columns adapt to screen size
- Dialog content scrollable on small screens
- Form fields use responsive grid (xs/sm/md/lg breakpoints)

### Visual Indicators
- Color-coded status chips
- Expired badge in details dialog
- Loading spinners during async operations
- Error alerts for failed operations
- Success notifications for completed actions

### User Feedback
- Snackbar notifications for all operations
- Inline error messages in dialogs
- Disabled buttons during processing
- Required field validation
- Character counters for text fields

## Code Quality

### Documentation
- XML comments on all public methods
- Clear section headers in UI
- Descriptive property names
- Inline comments for complex logic

### CQRS Pattern
- Separate commands for Create and Release
- Read operations use Response DTOs
- Search uses dedicated SearchCommand
- No update operation (reservations are create-then-release)

### DRY Principles
- Reusable `IsExpired()` helper method
- Shared status color mapping
- Common dialog patterns
- Centralized error handling

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks on all API calls
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation on failures
- Loading states during async operations

## Testing Scenarios

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Create reservation with all required fields
- [ ] Create reservation with optional fields
- [ ] Search by each filter individually
- [ ] Combine multiple search filters
- [ ] View details of different reservation statuses
- [ ] Release an active reservation
- [ ] Verify release button hidden for expired reservations
- [ ] Delete a reservation
- [ ] Verify unique reservation number validation

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Create reservation with expiration date in the past (should fail validation)
- [ ] Release without providing reason (button disabled)
- [ ] View details of reservation with null optional fields
- [ ] Search with no results
- [ ] Load page with no items/warehouses available

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Verify API client methods called correctly
- [ ] Confirm status changes after release
- [ ] Verify quantity returned to stock (backend verification)
- [ ] Test with expired reservations
- [ ] Test with different reservation types

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
1. **Bulk Operations** - Release or delete multiple reservations
2. **Reservation History** - View timeline of status changes
3. **Available Quantity Check** - Show available vs. reserved during creation
4. **Expiration Alerts** - Notifications for soon-to-expire reservations
5. **Quick Filters** - Preset filter buttons (My Reservations, Expiring Soon, etc.)
6. **Export** - Export reservation list to Excel/PDF
7. **Reservation Extension** - Extend expiration date dialog
8. **Linked Documents** - Navigate to source order/transfer from reservation

## Compliance

### Coding Standards
✅ Follows CQRS principles
✅ Each class in separate file
✅ XML documentation on entities, methods, functions
✅ Uses string-based enums (ReservationType)
✅ Tighter validation on all inputs
✅ Consistent with Catalog and Todo patterns
✅ No database check constraints
