## 📊 Key Concepts Reference

### **What is Cycle Counting?**
> Regular, scheduled counting of a portion of inventory instead of counting everything at once (annual physical inventory). Maintains continuous accuracy.

### **What is ABC Analysis?**
> Classification system where:
> - **A-items**: High value, count frequently (weekly)
> - **B-items**: Medium value, count monthly
> - **C-items**: Low value, count quarterly

### **What is Variance?**
> Difference between system quantity and physically counted quantity.
> **Formula**: Variance = Counted Quantity - System Quantity

### **What is Accuracy Percentage?**
> Percentage of items counted with zero variance.
> **Formula**: (Items With No Variance / Total Items) × 100

### **What is Shrinkage?**
> Loss of inventory due to theft, damage, spoilage, or administrative errors.
> Detected through negative variances during counting.

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### **Problem**: Low accuracy percentage (<90%)

**Check**:
1. Are counters properly trained?
2. Is barcode scanning working correctly?
3. Are items in correct locations?
4. Is system data up to date (all receipts processed)?

**Solutions**:
- Retrain counters on procedures
- Review and correct location data
- Process pending transactions before counting
- Implement two-person rule for high-value items

---

### **Problem**: High variance on specific items

**Check**:
1. Is item frequently handled?
2. Is item high-theft risk?
3. Is item poorly organized/hard to count?
4. Are receiving/shipping procedures followed?

**Solutions**:
- Increase count frequency for problem items
- Improve security measures
- Reorganize storage for better visibility
- Review and update procedures

---

### **Problem**: Counts taking too long

**Check**:
1. Are barcode scanners being used?
2. Are items well-organized?
3. Is counter familiar with location?
4. Is offline mode working (no delays)?

**Solutions**:
- Deploy barcode scanners
- Improve location organization
- Assign counters to familiar areas
- Ensure mobile app offline mode works

---
