## ✅ Coding Pattern Compliance

All entities follow the established patterns from Catalog and Todo modules:

### Entity Pattern:
- ✅ Private parameterless constructor for EF Core
- ✅ Private constructor with validation
- ✅ Static `Create` factory method
- ✅ `QueueDomainEvent` calls on all state changes
- ✅ Proper encapsulation with private setters
- ✅ Comprehensive XML documentation
- ✅ Business rule validation in domain layer
- ✅ Inheritance from `AuditableEntity` and `IAggregateRoot`

### Event Pattern:
- ✅ Sealed records inheriting from `DomainEvent`
- ✅ Descriptive event names (EntityAction format)
- ✅ Proper event data capture

### Exception Pattern:
- ✅ Sealed classes inheriting from framework exceptions
- ✅ Descriptive exception names
- ✅ Constructor with message parameter
- ✅ Proper exception inheritance (`NotFoundException`, `ForbiddenException`, `BadRequestException`)

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. **Create Application Layer** (CQRS handlers) for all 6 entities:
   - Create/Update/Get/Delete operations
   - Transaction operations (Approve, Post, etc.)

2. **Create Configurations:**
   - EF Core entity configurations
   - Database migrations
   - Table mappings

3. **Create API Endpoints:**

   - Aggregate roots with clear boundaries
   - Value objects for complex types
   - Domain events for state changes
   - Business rules enforced in domain

2. **CQRS Pattern**
   - Commands for state changes
   - Queries for data retrieval
   - Handlers for processing

3. **Repository Pattern**
   - Keyed services for different aggregates
   - Clean data access abstraction

4. **Event Sourcing**

## 📖 Documentation Quality

All entities include:
- ✅ Comprehensive XML summaries
- ✅ Use case descriptions
- ✅ Default value documentation
- ✅ Business rule explanations
- ✅ Property-level documentation
- ✅ Method behavior descriptions

---

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **ApprovalStatus Enum:** Created shared enum for entities requiring approval workflows
2. **Property Hiding:** Used `new` keyword for properties that override `AuditableEntity` base properties
3. **Null Safety:** Ensured all domain events receive non-null strings using null-coalescing operator
4. **Tolerance in Reconciliation:** Implemented 1-cent tolerance for balance matching due to rounding
5. **Three-Way Matching:** PurchaseOrder entity implements complete procurement validation chain
