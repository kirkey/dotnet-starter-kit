## 🔗 Integration Architecture

### Existing Entity Relationships
```
Bill → Vendor, PurchaseOrder, Payment, ChartOfAccount
InterconnectionAgreement → Member, Meter, Invoice, RateSchedule
PowerPurchaseAgreement → Vendor, ChartOfAccount
Customer → Invoice, Payment, RateSchedule
PrepaidExpense → Vendor, Payment, JournalEntry, ChartOfAccount
InterCompanyTransaction → ChartOfAccount, JournalEntry
RetainedEarnings → ChartOfAccount, AccountingPeriod
```

### Domain Event Flow
```
User Action → Command → Handler → Entity Method → Domain Event → Event Handler → Side Effects
```

## 🎓 Learning Resources

### Understanding the Entities

**Bill vs Invoice:**
- Bill = Vendor invoice (AP/payable)
- Invoice = Customer invoice (AR/receivable)

**Customer vs Member:**
- Customer = General business customer
- Member = Utility customer/cooperative member

**InterconnectionAgreement vs PowerPurchaseAgreement:**
- Interconnection = Customer generating power (net metering)
- PPA = Utility buying power wholesale (major purchase)

### Key Accounting Concepts
- **Prepaid Expense:** Asset that becomes expense over time
- **Retained Earnings:** Accumulated profits minus distributions
- **Inter-Company:** Transactions between related entities
- **Net Metering:** Customer generation offsetting consumption
