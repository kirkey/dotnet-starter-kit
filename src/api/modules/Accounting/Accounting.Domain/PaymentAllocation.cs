/// <summary>
/// Represents an allocation of a payment amount to a specific invoice for accounts receivable management.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Use cases:
/// - Split a single payment across multiple outstanding invoices for the same customer.
/// - Apply partial payments to specific invoices based on customer preferences or aging.
/// - Track payment application for accounts receivable aging and collection reporting.
/// - Support payment reconciliation and dispute resolution with detailed allocation records.
/// - Enable automatic payment allocation based on business rules (oldest first, by invoice number).
/// - Handle overpayments by allocating exact amounts and tracking remaining credits.
/// - Support payment reversals and reallocation for billing adjustments.
/// 
/// Default values:
/// - PaymentId: required reference to parent payment entity
/// - InvoiceId: required reference to target invoice being paid
/// - Amount: required positive decimal amount (example: 150.00 for partial payment)
/// - Notes: optional allocation notes (example: "Applied to oldest outstanding balance")
/// - AllocationDate: system timestamp when allocation is created
/// 
/// Business rules:
/// - Amount must be positive (cannot allocate negative amounts)
/// - Total allocations for a payment cannot exceed the payment amount
/// - Cannot allocate to an invoice that is already fully paid
/// - Allocation creates a credit on the target invoice
/// - Cannot delete allocation after invoice is marked as paid
/// - Must maintain referential integrity with payment and invoice entities
