/// <summary>
/// Represents retained earnings for a fiscal year with tracking of opening balances, net income, distributions, and equity changes.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Use cases:
/// - Track annual retained earnings movements for equity reporting.
/// - Support statement of changes in equity preparation.
/// - Manage dividend and patronage distribution allocation.
/// - Track capital contributions and withdrawals for cooperatives.
/// - Enable year-end closing and retained earnings appropriation.
/// - Support regulatory reporting for equity structure and capital adequacy.
/// - Track appropriated vs unappropriated retained earnings.
/// - Enable multi-year retained earnings trend analysis.
/// 
/// Default values:
/// - FiscalYear: required year (example: 2025)
/// - OpeningBalance: carried forward from prior year closing
/// - NetIncome: 0.00 (updated from income statement)
/// - Distributions: 0.00 (dividends, patronage, or other distributions)
/// - CapitalContributions: 0.00 (member or shareholder contributions)
/// - OtherEquityChanges: 0.00 (adjustments, restatements)
/// - ClosingBalance: calculated as Opening + Net Income - Distributions + Contributions + Other
/// - Status: "Open" (active year), "Closed" (finalized)
/// - IsClosed: false (year is still open)
/// - ClosedDate: null (set when year closed)
/// 
/// Business rules:
/// - FiscalYear must be unique (one record per year)
/// - FiscalYear must be reasonable (1900-2100)
/// - Opening balance typically equals prior year closing balance
/// - Closing balance = Opening + NetIncome - Distributions + Contributions + Other
/// - Cannot modify closed years without proper authorization
/// - Net income transferred from income statement at year-end
/// - Distributions cannot exceed available retained earnings
/// - Status transitions: Open â†’ Closed
/// - Year-end closing creates next year's opening balance
