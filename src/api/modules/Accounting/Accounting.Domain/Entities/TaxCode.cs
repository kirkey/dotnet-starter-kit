/// <summary>
/// Represents a tax code configuration for sales tax, VAT, GST and other tax calculations.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Use cases:
/// - Configure tax rates for different jurisdictions and tax types.
/// - Support multiple tax components (state, county, city, district taxes).
/// - Calculate tax amounts on invoices, bills, and other taxable transactions.
/// - Track tax collected and tax paid for reporting and remittance.
/// - Enable automatic tax calculation based on transaction types and locations.
/// - Support compound taxes and tax-on-tax scenarios.
/// - Maintain historical tax rates with effective date tracking.
/// 
/// Default values:
/// - TaxType: Sales Tax (most common in general accounting)
/// - Rate: required (decimal percentage, e.g., 0.0825 for 8.25%)
/// - IsActive: true (tax code is active and available)
/// - IsCompound: false (tax is not calculated on other taxes)
/// - EffectiveDate: required (when this rate becomes active)
/// - ExpiryDate: null (rate continues indefinitely)
/// - TaxCollectedAccountId: required (liability account for tax collected)
/// - TaxPaidAccountId: null (expense account for tax paid, for purchase tax)
/// 
/// Business rules:
/// - Tax rate must be between 0 and 1 (0% to 100%)
/// - Effective date cannot be in the past when creating new rates
/// - Cannot modify tax code once transactions have used it
/// - Compound taxes calculate on subtotal plus other non-compound taxes
/// - Must specify collection account for remittance tracking
/// - Can have multiple rates for same tax code (different effective dates)
/// - Jurisdiction determines applicability of tax code
/// </remarks>
