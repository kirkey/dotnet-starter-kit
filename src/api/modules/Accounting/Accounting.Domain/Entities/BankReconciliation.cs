/// <summary>
/// Represents a bank reconciliation process matching bank statements with general ledger cash accounts.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Use cases:
/// - Match bank statement transactions with recorded cash receipts and disbursements.
/// - Identify outstanding checks, deposits in transit, and bank errors.
/// - Verify accuracy of cash account balances and detect discrepancies.
/// - Support monthly/periodic reconciliation workflows with approval process.
/// - Track reconciliation items that require investigation or adjustment.
/// - Maintain audit trail of all reconciliation activities and adjustments.
/// - Generate reconciliation reports for management review and compliance.
/// 
/// Default values:
/// - Status: Pending (new reconciliations start in pending status)
/// - IsReconciled: false (becomes true when completed and approved)
/// - ReconciliationDate: required (statement date being reconciled)
/// - StatementBalance: required (ending balance per bank statement)
/// - BookBalance: required (balance per general ledger before adjustments)
/// - AdjustedBalance: calculated (book balance + adjustments)
/// - OutstandingChecksTotal: 0.00 (sum of checks not yet cleared)
/// - DepositsInTransitTotal: 0.00 (sum of deposits not yet on statement)
/// - BankErrors: 0.00 (errors on bank's side)
/// - BookErrors: 0.00 (errors in books requiring adjustment entries)
/// 
/// Business rules:
/// - Reconciliation date cannot be in the future
/// - Cannot modify reconciliation once marked as reconciled
/// - Statement balance and book balance must be provided
/// - Outstanding items must be tracked individually with references
/// - Final adjusted book balance must equal statement balance (after adjustments)
/// - Requires approval workflow before marking as reconciled
/// - Should link to bank account in chart of accounts
/// </remarks>
