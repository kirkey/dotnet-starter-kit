/// <summary>
/// Represents a prepaid expense asset for tracking advance payments and systematic amortization over benefit periods.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Use cases:
/// - Track insurance premiums paid in advance and amortize monthly.
/// - Manage prepaid maintenance contracts and service agreements.
/// - Handle prepaid rent, subscriptions, and annual licenses.
/// - Support accurate period-end financial reporting with proper matching.
/// - Enable automated monthly amortization journal entries.
/// - Track remaining prepaid balances for balance sheet reporting.
/// - Support audit trail for prepayment recognition and amortization.
/// - Enable prepaid expense forecasting and budget management.
/// 
/// Default values:
/// - PrepaidNumber: required unique identifier (example: "PREPAID-2025-001")
/// - Description: required description (example: "Annual insurance premium - FY2025")
/// - TotalAmount: required total prepaid amount (example: 12000.00 for annual insurance)
/// - StartDate: required benefit period start (example: 2025-01-01)
/// - EndDate: required benefit period end (example: 2025-12-31)
/// - AmortizedAmount: 0.00 (no amortization initially)
/// - RemainingAmount: equals TotalAmount initially
/// - AmortizationSchedule: "Monthly" (most common frequency)
/// - Status: "Active" (new prepaid expenses start as active)
/// - IsFullyAmortized: false (becomes true when fully amortized)
/// 
/// Business rules:
/// - PrepaidNumber must be unique within the system
/// - TotalAmount must be positive
/// - EndDate must be after StartDate
/// - AmortizedAmount cannot exceed TotalAmount
/// - RemainingAmount = TotalAmount - AmortizedAmount
/// - Monthly amortization = TotalAmount / NumberOfMonths
/// - Cannot delete prepaid expenses with amortization history
/// - Status transitions: Active → FullyAmortized → Closed
/// - Amortization stops when RemainingAmount reaches zero
/// - Requires GL account for prepaid asset and expense account
