/// Bundle Creation:
/// - StartCheckNumber: The first check number in the range (e.g., "3453000")
/// - EndCheckNumber: The last check number in the range (e.g., "3453500")
/// - Creates all sequential check numbers from StartCheckNumber to EndCheckNumber inclusive
/// 
/// Auto-Fetching Behavior:
/// - BankAccountCode: Used to look up ChartOfAccount and retrieve BankAccountName
/// - BankId: If provided, used to look up Bank and retrieve BankName
/// - BankAccountName and BankName are automatically populated from their respective lookups
/// 
/// Applied to all checks in the bundle.
