# StockAdjustments Application - Completion Report

## Date: October 25, 2025

## Summary
The StockAdjustments application has been fully reviewed and enhanced with event handler implementations. All missing transaction tracking has been added, ensuring a complete audit trail for stock adjustments with intelligent transaction type routing based on adjustment types.

---

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

### What Was Already Implemented
- Complete CRUD operations
- Approve operation for adjustment authorization
- Domain entity with comprehensive adjustment types
- Validators for all commands
- API endpoints properly secured and documented
- Search functionality with comprehensive filters
- Financial impact tracking (unit cost × quantity)

### What Was Added 🆕

**Two Event Handlers for Complete Audit Trail:**

#### 1. StockAdjustmentCreatedHandler 🆕 ⭐
**The Smart Router**

- Creates InventoryTransaction when adjustment is created
- **Intelligent transaction type routing**:
  - **Increase/Found** → IN transaction
  - **Decrease/Write-Off/Damage/Loss** → OUT transaction
  - **Physical Count** → IN or OUT based on result
  - **Other types** → ADJUSTMENT transaction
- Transaction number: `TXN-ADJ-YYYYMMDD-NNNNNN`
- Records complete adjustment details in notes
- Includes financial impact (cost × quantity)
- Marks as unapproved (pending authorization)

**Smart Routing Logic**:
```
Increase → IN (ADJUSTMENT_INCREASE)
Found → IN (ADJUSTMENT_FOUND)
Decrease → OUT (ADJUSTMENT_DECREASE)
Write-Off → OUT (ADJUSTMENT_WRITEOFF)
Damage → OUT (ADJUSTMENT_DAMAGE)
Loss → OUT (ADJUSTMENT_LOSS)
Physical Count → IN or OUT (ADJUSTMENT_PHYSICAL_COUNT)
Other → ADJUSTMENT (ADJUSTMENT_{TYPE})
```

#### 2. StockAdjustmentApprovedHandler 🆕
**The Synchronizer**

- Updates transaction approval when adjustment is approved
- Finds transaction(s) by adjustment number reference
- Calls `transaction.Approve(approvedBy)` for consistency
- Maintains synchronized approval state
- Handles multiple transactions if needed

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### Intelligent Transaction Routing
The **CreatedHandler** automatically determines the correct transaction type:

**Stock Increases** (add to inventory):
```
Type: Increase/Found
→ Transaction Type: IN
→ Reason: ADJUSTMENT_INCREASE or ADJUSTMENT_FOUND
→ Effect: Adds to inventory count
```

**Stock Decreases** (remove from inventory):
```
Type: Decrease/Write-Off/Damage/Loss
→ Transaction Type: OUT
→ Reason: ADJUSTMENT_DECREASE/WRITEOFF/DAMAGE/LOSS
→ Effect: Reduces inventory count
```

**Physical Count** (context-dependent):
```
If QuantityAfter > QuantityBefore:
  → Transaction Type: IN
  
If QuantityAfter < QuantityBefore:
  → Transaction Type: OUT
```

### Financial Impact Tracking
Every adjustment records:
- Unit cost at time of adjustment
- Total cost impact (quantity × unit cost)
- Sign based on type (positive for increase, negative for decrease)
- Supports variance analysis and accounting

## Transaction Flow Examples

### Example 1: Physical Count Reveals Surplus
```
Scenario: Count shows 120 units, expected 100

StockAdjustment Created:
  AdjustmentNumber: ADJ-2025-001
  Type: Physical Count
  QuantityBefore: 100
  AdjustmentQuantity: 20
  QuantityAfter: 120
  UnitCost: $10.00
  TotalCostImpact: +$200.00

Transaction Created: TXN-ADJ-20251025-000001
  Type: IN
  Reason: ADJUSTMENT_PHYSICAL_COUNT
  Quantity: 20
  UnitCost: $10.00
  TotalCost: $200.00
  IsApproved: false

After Approval:
  Adjustment.IsApproved = true
  Transaction.IsApproved = true
```

### Example 2: Damaged Goods
```
Scenario: 5 units damaged, must be written off

StockAdjustment Created:
  AdjustmentNumber: ADJ-2025-002
  Type: Damage
  QuantityBefore: 100
  AdjustmentQuantity: 5
  QuantityAfter: 95
  UnitCost: $10.00
  TotalCostImpact: -$50.00
  Reason: "Damaged by forklift"

Transaction Created: TXN-ADJ-20251025-000002
  Type: OUT
  Reason: ADJUSTMENT_DAMAGE
  Quantity: 5
  UnitCost: $10.00
  TotalCost: $50.00
  Notes: "Stock Adjustment ADJ-2025-002: Damage. Reason: Damaged by forklift..."
  IsApproved: false

After Approval:
  Adjustment.IsApproved = true
  Transaction.IsApproved = true
  Financial impact: -$50.00 recorded
```

### Example 3: Found Inventory
```
Scenario: 10 units found during warehouse cleanup

StockAdjustment Created:
  AdjustmentNumber: ADJ-2025-003
  Type: Found
  QuantityBefore: 100
  AdjustmentQuantity: 10
  QuantityAfter: 110
  UnitCost: $10.00
  TotalCostImpact: +$100.00
  Reason: "Found in mislabeled location"

Transaction Created: TXN-ADJ-20251025-000003
  Type: IN
  Reason: ADJUSTMENT_FOUND
  Quantity: 10
  UnitCost: $10.00
  TotalCost: $100.00
  IsApproved: false

After Approval:
  Adjustment.IsApproved = true
  Transaction.IsApproved = true
  Financial impact: +$100.00 recorded
```

## Testing Recommendations 🧪

### Unit Tests
```csharp
[Theory]
[InlineData("Increase", "IN", "ADJUSTMENT_INCREASE")]
[InlineData("Found", "IN", "ADJUSTMENT_FOUND")]
[InlineData("Decrease", "OUT", "ADJUSTMENT_DECREASE")]
[InlineData("Damage", "OUT", "ADJUSTMENT_DAMAGE")]
[InlineData("Write-Off", "OUT", "ADJUSTMENT_WRITEOFF")]
public void StockAdjustmentCreatedHandler_ShouldCreateCorrectTransactionType(
    string adjustmentType, 
    string expectedType, 
    string expectedReason)
{
    // Test smart routing for each adjustment type
}

[Fact]
public void StockAdjustmentApprovedHandler_ShouldApproveRelatedTransaction()
{
    // Create adjustment → Create transaction
    // Approve adjustment → Verify transaction approved
}

[Fact]
public void PhysicalCountAdjustment_ShouldDetermineDirectionCorrectly()
{
    // If count > before → IN transaction
    // If count < before → OUT transaction
}
```

### Integration Tests
```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task CreateDamageAdjustment_ShouldCreateOutTransaction()
{
    // Create damage adjustment
    // Verify OUT transaction with ADJUSTMENT_DAMAGE reason
    // Verify negative cost impact
}

[Fact]
public async Task ApproveAdjustment_ShouldSynchronizeTransactionApproval()
{
    // Create adjustment (unapproved)
    // Verify transaction is unapproved
    // Approve adjustment
    // Verify transaction is now approved
}
```
