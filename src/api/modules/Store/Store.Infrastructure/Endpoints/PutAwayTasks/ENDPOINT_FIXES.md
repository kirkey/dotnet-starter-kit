# PutAwayTasks Endpoints Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The PutAwayTasks endpoints were not being properly generated by NSwag because they did not follow the correct pattern used by other endpoints like PickLists.

## Problems Found

### 1. **IMediator vs ISender**
All endpoints were using `IMediator` instead of `ISender`, which is the modern MediatR pattern used in PickLists.

### 2. **StartPutAwayEndpoint & CompletePutAwayEndpoint**
These endpoints were creating commands internally instead of accepting them as request body parameters, preventing NSwag from generating proper client methods.

### 3. **AddPutAwayTaskItemEndpoint**
Was using a DTO instead of the command directly as the request parameter.

### 4. **AssignPutAwayTaskEndpoint**
Was using `with` syntax to modify the command instead of returning `BadRequest` for ID mismatch.

### 5. **Domain Entity Issues**
- `PutAwayTask.AddItem()` method was missing the `sequenceNumber` parameter
- `PutAwayTask` entity was missing the `Notes` property declaration
- `PutAwayTaskItem` entity was missing the `Notes` property declaration
- `AddPutAwayTaskItemCommand` was using positional record syntax instead of properties

## Files Fixed

### Backend Endpoints (All in `/api/modules/Store/Store.Infrastructure/Endpoints/PutAwayTasks/v1/`)

1. **StartPutAwayEndpoint.cs**
   - ✅ Changed `IMediator` to `ISender`
   - ✅ Added `StartPutAwayCommand` as request body parameter
   - ✅ Added ID mismatch validation with `BadRequest` return
   - ✅ Improved description

2. **CompletePutAwayEndpoint.cs**
   - ✅ Changed `IMediator` to `ISender`
   - ✅ Added `CompletePutAwayCommand` as request body parameter
   - ✅ Added ID mismatch validation with `BadRequest` return
   - ✅ Improved description

3. **AddPutAwayTaskItemEndpoint.cs**
   - ✅ Changed `IMediator` to `ISender`
   - ✅ Changed to use `AddPutAwayTaskItemCommand` directly instead of DTO
   - ✅ Added ID mismatch validation with `BadRequest` return
   - ✅ Improved description

4. **AssignPutAwayTaskEndpoint.cs**
   - ✅ Changed `IMediator` to `ISender`
   - ✅ Changed from `with` syntax to `BadRequest` return for ID mismatch
   - ✅ Improved description

5. **CreatePutAwayTaskEndpoint.cs**
   - ✅ Changed `IMediator` to `ISender`
   - ✅ Improved description

6. **SearchPutAwayTasksEndpoint.cs**
   - ✅ Changed `IMediator` to `ISender`
   - ✅ Improved description

7. **DeletePutAwayTaskEndpoint.cs**
   - ✅ Changed `IMediator` to `ISender`
   - ✅ Improved description

8. **GetPutAwayTaskEndpoint.cs**
   - ✅ Changed `IMediator` to `ISender`
   - ✅ Improved description

### Backend Application Layer

9. **AddPutAwayTaskItemCommand.cs**
   - ✅ Converted from positional record to property-based record
   - ✅ Added `SequenceNumber` property
   - ✅ Renamed `Quantity` to `QuantityToPutAway` for clarity

10. **AddPutAwayTaskItemHandler.cs**
    - ✅ Updated to use new property names (`QuantityToPutAway`, `SequenceNumber`)

### Backend Domain Layer

11. **PutAwayTask.cs** (`/api/modules/Store/Store.Domain/Entities/`)
    - ✅ Added missing `Notes` property
    - ✅ Updated `AddItem()` method to accept `sequenceNumber` parameter
    - ✅ Added `SetSequence()` call in `AddItem()` method

12. **PutAwayTaskItem.cs** (`/api/modules/Store/Store.Domain/Entities/`)
    - ✅ Added missing `Notes` property

## Pattern Consistency

All endpoints now follow the **PickLists pattern**:

```csharp
// CORRECT PATTERN (Now used everywhere)
.MapPost("/{id}/action", async (DefaultIdType id, CommandType request, ISender sender) =>
{
    if (id != request.EntityId)
    {
        return Results.BadRequest("Entity ID mismatch");
    }
    
    var response = await sender.Send(request).ConfigureAwait(false);
    return Results.Ok(response);
})
```

## Benefits

1. **NSwag will now generate proper client methods** for all endpoints
2. **Consistent code patterns** across all Store endpoints
3. **Better validation** with explicit ID mismatch checks
4. **Modern MediatR usage** with `ISender` instead of `IMediator`
5. **Complete domain model** with all required properties

## Next Steps

1. Build the API project: `dotnet build`
2. Regenerate NSwag client (this will now include all methods):
   - `StartPutAwayEndpointAsync`
   - `CompletePutAwayEndpointAsync`
   - `AddPutAwayTaskItemEndpointAsync`
   - `GetPutAwayTaskEndpointAsync`
   - All other endpoints
3. Build the Blazor client project
4. Test all workflow operations in the UI

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create put-away task
- [ ] Add items to task
- [ ] Assign task to worker
- [ ] Start put-away
- [ ] Complete put-away
- [ ] View task details
- [ ] Search and filter tasks
- [ ] Delete task
