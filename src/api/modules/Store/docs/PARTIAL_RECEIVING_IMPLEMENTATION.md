# Partial Receiving System - Implementation Documentation

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Module:** Store.GoodsReceipts / Store.PurchaseOrders

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive partial receiving system has been successfully implemented in the Store module, following CQRS and DRY principles with strict validation and complete documentation. This system enables warehouses to receive purchase orders in multiple shipments, track received vs remaining quantities, manage back-orders, and maintain accurate inventory levels throughout the receiving process.

---

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All components have been implemented and successfully compiled across all three layers:
- ✅ Domain Layer (Entities with partial receiving support, Events)
- ✅ Application Layer (Commands, Queries, Handlers, Validators)
- ✅ Infrastructure Layer (Database Configuration, API Endpoints)

---

## Overview

The Partial Receiving System provides a complete solution for handling purchase orders that arrive in multiple shipments. It tracks quantities at the line-item level, maintains accurate received vs ordered quantities, manages back-orders, updates purchase order statuses automatically, and ensures data integrity throughout the receiving lifecycle.

### Key Features

1. **Multiple Receipts per PO** - Create multiple goods receipts against a single purchase order
2. **Line-Item Tracking** - Track received quantity at individual PO line item level
3. **Remaining Quantity Calculation** - Automatically calculate quantities still to be received
4. **Back-Order Management** - Identify and manage items on back-order
5. **PO Status Automation** - Automatically update PO status (Submitted → Partially Received → Received)
6. **Over-Receipt Prevention** - Prevent receiving more than ordered quantity
7. **Variance Tracking** - Track variances between ordered and received quantities per shipment
8. **Progress Monitoring** - Real-time visibility into receiving completion percentage
9. **Receipt History** - Complete audit trail of all receipts against a PO
10. **Integration Ready** - Seamless integration with inventory, accounting, and supplier systems

## Components Implemented

### 1. Domain Layer (`Store.Domain`)

#### Enhanced Entities

**PurchaseOrderItem.cs** - Enhanced with partial receiving support
- **Key Properties:**
  - `Quantity` (int) - Total quantity ordered from supplier
  - `ReceivedQuantity` (int) - Cumulative quantity received across all receipts
  - `RemainingQuantity` (computed) - Quantity = ReceivedQuantity (calculated on-demand)
  - `IsFullyReceived` (computed) - ReceivedQuantity >= Quantity

- **Business Methods:**
  - `ReceiveQuantity(int receivedQuantity)` - Update received quantity
    - Validates received quantity doesn't exceed ordered
    - Raises PurchaseOrderItemReceived event
    - Returns updated item for chaining

- **Validation Rules:**
  - ReceivedQuantity cannot be negative
  - ReceivedQuantity cannot exceed Quantity
  - Cannot reduce Quantity below ReceivedQuantity
  - All validations throw domain exceptions

**GoodsReceiptItem.cs** - Links to PO line items for tracking

- **Business Methods:**
  - `UpdateReceivingStatus()` - Automatically determines and sets correct status
    - Checks all line items received quantities
    - Sets PartiallyReceived if any items received but not all complete
    - Sets Received when all items fully received
    - Raises appropriate domain events

#### Domain Events (6 Events)

1. **PurchaseOrderItemReceived** - When quantity is received against PO line
   - Properties: PurchaseOrderItem, PreviousReceivedQuantity, NewReceivedQuantity
   - Triggered: After receipt posted to inventory

2. **PurchaseOrderPartiallyReceived** - When first partial receipt occurs
   - Properties: PurchaseOrderId, OrderNumber, TotalReceived, TotalOrdered, PercentageReceived
   - Triggered: When status changes to PartiallyReceived

3. **PurchaseOrderFullyReceived** - When all items received
   - Properties: PurchaseOrderId, OrderNumber, TotalReceived, CompletedDate
   - Triggered: When status changes to Received

4. **GoodsReceiptCompleted** - When goods receipt is finalized
   - Properties: GoodsReceiptId, PurchaseOrderId, UpdatedPOStatus
   - Triggered: After inventory and PO updates applied

5. **BackOrderIdentified** - When remaining quantity detected
   - Properties: PurchaseOrderItemId, ProductId, RemainingQuantity, ExpectedDeliveryDate
   - Triggered: When receipt shows partial delivery

6. **OverReceiptDetected** - When received quantity exceeds ordered
   - Properties: PurchaseOrderItemId, OrderedQuantity, ReceivedQuantity, ExcessQuantity
   - Triggered: Validation failure or requires approval

#### Exceptions (4 Custom Exceptions)

1. **ReceivedQuantityExceedsOrderedException** - Attempting to receive more than ordered

```

### Workflow 2: Multi-Line Partial Receiving (3 Items, Mixed Completion)

**Scenario:** PO with 3 items, received in 2 shipments with mixed completion

**Initial PO:**
```
PO-2025-09-010
- Item A: 100 units ordered
- Item B: 50 units ordered  
- Item C: 75 units ordered
Total: 225 units
```

**First Receipt:**
```json
POST /store/goods-receipts
{
  "receiptNumber": "GR-2025-10-020",
  "purchaseOrderId": "po-2025-09-010",
  "notes": "First shipment - mixed items"
}

// Add Item A - Fully received
POST /store/goods-receipts/gr-020/items
{
  "purchaseOrderItemId": "po-item-a",
  "quantityOrdered": 100,
  "quantityReceived": 100,
  "notes": "Item A fully received"
}

// Add Item B - Partial
POST /store/goods-receipts/gr-020/items
{
  "purchaseOrderItemId": "po-item-b",
  "quantityOrdered": 50,
  "quantityReceived": 30,
  "varianceReason": "20 units back-ordered",
  "notes": "Item B partial"
}

// Add Item C - Not in this shipment
// (No goods receipt item created)

POST /store/goods-receipts/gr-020/mark-received

// Results After First Receipt:
// - Item A: 100/100 (100%) - Fully received ✓
// - Item B: 30/50 (60%) - Partially received
// - Item C: 0/75 (0%) - Not received
// - PO Status: PartiallyReceived (1 of 3 items complete)
```

**Second Receipt:**
```json
POST /store/goods-receipts
{
  "receiptNumber": "GR-2025-11-005",
  "purchaseOrderId": "po-2025-09-010",
  "notes": "Second shipment - completing order"
}

// Add Item B - Remaining quantity
POST /store/goods-receipts/gr-005/items
{
  "purchaseOrderItemId": "po-item-b",
  "quantityOrdered": 50,
  "quantityReceived": 20,
  "notes": "Item B back-order received"
}

// - Item C: 75/75 (100%) - Fully received ✓
// - PO Status: Received (all 3 items complete)
// - Event: PurchaseOrderFullyReceived emitted
```

### Workflow 3: Over-Receipt Handling (Requires Approval)

**Scenario:** Supplier ships more than ordered, requires special handling

```json
POST /store/goods-receipts/gr-030/items
{
  "purchaseOrderItemId": "po-item-001",
  "quantityOrdered": 100,
  "quantityReceived": 110,  // 10 units over
  "varianceReason": "Supplier shipped extra units - bonus inventory",
  "notes": "Manager approval required for over-receipt"
}

// Validation Check:
// - System detects: 110 > 100 (over-receipt)
// - Validation rule: ReceivedQuantity > OrderedQuantity not allowed by default
// - Error: ReceivedQuantityExceedsOrderedException thrown

// Resolution Options:

// Option 1: Increase PO quantity first (if allowed)
PUT /store/purchase-orders/po-001/items/po-item-001
{
  "quantity": 110,
  "approvalReason": "Accept supplier bonus units"
}
// Then receive normally

// Option 2: Receive exact quantity, reject excess
POST /store/goods-receipts/gr-030/items
{
  "quantityOrdered": 100,
  "quantityReceived": 100,
  "quantityRejected": 10,
  "varianceReason": "Rejected 10 excess units - return to supplier"
}

// Option 3: Create separate direct receipt for excess (no PO)
POST /store/goods-receipts
{
  "receiptNumber": "GR-2025-10-031",
  // No purchaseOrderId - direct receipt
  "notes": "Bonus units from supplier - no PO"
}
POST /store/goods-receipts/gr-031/items
{
  "productId": "product-widget-a",
  "quantityReceived": 10,
  "unitCost": 0.00,  // Free bonus
  "notes": "Promotional units from supplier"
}
```

### Workflow 4: Receiving Progress Monitoring

**Query Current Status:**
```json
GET /store/purchase-orders/po-001/receiving-status

Response:
{
  "purchaseOrderId": "po-001",
  "orderNumber": "PO-2025-09-001",
  "status": "PartiallyReceived",
  "orderDate": "2025-09-15",

      "remaining": 60,
      "progress": 60,
      "status": "Partial"
    },
    // ... more items
  ],
  "receipts": [
    {
      "receiptNumber": "GR-2025-10-001",
      "receivedDate": "2025-10-24",
      "quantity": 184,

      "quantity": 100,
      "status": "Received"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Workflow 5: Cancelling Partial Receipt

**Scenario:** Need to cancel a receipt after some items already received

```json
// Current state: PO has 2 receipts, partially received
// Receipt 1: 60 units received ✓ (Posted to inventory)
// Receipt 2: 40 units received (Draft, not yet posted)

// Option 1: Delete draft receipt (before posting)
DELETE /store/goods-receipts/gr-002
Response: { "success": true, "inventoryReverted": false }
// No impact to PO since receipt not posted

// Option 2: Cancel posted receipt (after inventory update)
POST /store/goods-receipts/gr-001/cancel
{
  "reason": "Items damaged, returning to supplier"
}
Response: {
  "success": true,
  "inventoryReverted": true,
  "reversalTransactionId": "inv-txn-9999"
}

// System Actions:
// - Inventory: Revert -60 units
// - PO Item ReceivedQuantity: 60 → 0
// - PO Item RemainingQuantity: 40 → 100
// - PO Status: PartiallyReceived → Submitted (or previous status)
// - Create reversal inventory transaction
// - Emit GoodsReceiptCancelled event
// - Update receiving history with cancellation
```

## Use Cases

### 1. **Standard Split Shipment Receiving**
**Scenario:** Supplier splits order into 2 trucks due to weight limits

**Business Need:**
- Track each truck's delivery separately
- Ensure inventory updates in real-time
- Know what's still coming
- Alert receiving team when complete

**Process:**
1. Truck 1 arrives with 60% of order
2. Receiving clerk creates first goods receipt
3. Links line items to PO with quantities received
4. System updates PO to "PartiallyReceived"
5. Inventory increased for received items
6. System shows 40% remaining on dashboard
7. Truck 2 arrives days later with remaining 40%
8. Clerk creates second goods receipt
9. System completes PO and marks "Received"
10. Purchasing notified order complete

**Benefits:**
- Real-time inventory accuracy
- Clear visibility of back-orders
- Automated PO status management
- Complete audit trail

### 2. **Back-Order Management**
**Scenario:** Supplier can't fulfill full order, ships available stock first

**Business Need:**
- Accept partial shipment
- Track back-ordered quantities
- Reschedule expected delivery
- Alert purchasing to follow up with supplier

**Process:**
1. Receive partial shipment with variance reason
2. System identifies back-ordered items
3. Creates back-order record with quantities
4. Sends notification to purchasing
5. Purchasing contacts supplier for ETA
6. Updates expected delivery date in system
7. When back-order arrives, links to same PO
8. System completes the order

**Benefits:**
- Don't reject entire shipment due to shortages
- Track back-orders systematically
- Maintain supplier relationships
- Ensure nothing falls through cracks

### 3. **Multiple Warehouse Delivery**
**Scenario:** Large PO split between 3 warehouses

**Business Need:**
- Same PO, different warehouses
- Each warehouse receives their portion
- Central visibility of total received
- Coordinate with distribution plan

**Process:**
1. PO created with 300 units total
2. Supplier ships:
   - 100 units to Warehouse A
   - 120 units to Warehouse B
   - 80 units to Warehouse C
3. Each warehouse creates goods receipt independently
4. All link to same PO but different warehouses
5. System tracks total: 300/300 units across locations
6. PO marked complete when all warehouses receive
7. Corporate sees consolidated receiving status

**Benefits:**
- Centralized PO management
- Decentralized receiving
- Real-time cross-warehouse visibility
- Accurate inventory by location

### 4. **Quality Hold Partial Release**
**Scenario:** Receiving 1000 units, quality issues found in subset

**Business Need:**
- Receive full quantity
- Hold suspect items for inspection
- Release good items to inventory immediately
- Track inspection progress

**Process:**
1. Receive 1000 units against PO
2. Quality inspection identifies 100 questionable units
3. Create single goods receipt with two entries:
   - 900 units: QualityStatus = "Passed" → Inventory
   - 100 units: QualityStatus = "Quarantined" → Hold area
4. PO shows 900 received for reorder calcs
5. Inspection completes on 100 units:
   - 80 pass → Create supplemental receipt for 80
   - 20 fail → Return to supplier, adjust PO
6. Final PO status: 980 received, 20 rejected

**Benefits:**
- Don't hold entire shipment for partial issue
- Track quality issues separately
- Maintain accurate available inventory
- Support quality processes

### 5. **Rush Order Expedited Receiving**
**Scenario:** Critical parts needed ASAP, supplier air-freights portion

**Business Need:**
- Receive urgent items first (air freight)
- Receive remaining items later (ground shipping)
- Fast-track urgent items to production
- Track premium freight costs separately

**Process:**
1. PO for 200 units, 50 needed urgently
2. Supplier air-freights 50 units
3. Create first receipt:
   - 50 units received
   - Flag as "Rush/Expedited"
   - Record premium freight cost
4. Immediately available to production
5. Remaining 150 units arrive via ground (cheaper)
6. Create second receipt for 150 units
7. PO complete, costs properly allocated

**Benefits:**
- Support production urgency
- Track expedited shipping costs
- Normal receiving for balance

   - Week 1: 2,000 units
   - Week 2: 2,000 units
   - Week 3: 2,000 units
   - Week 4: 2,000 units
   - Week 5: 2,000 units
3. Create separate goods receipt each week
4. System tracks progress: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%
5. Inventory turns over as goods sold
6. Final delivery completes just before peak season

**Benefits:**
- Manage warehouse capacity
- Reduce carrying costs
- Maintain freshness of inventory
- Coordinate with sales demand

### 8. **Contract Manufacturing Staged Delivery**
**Scenario:** Manufacturing PO with materials received over project timeline

**Business Need:**
- PO for custom manufacturing job
- Materials received as production progresses
- Track project milestones
- Coordinate with production schedule

**Process:**
1. PO for complete project (all materials)
2. Supplier delivers materials in stages:
   - Stage 1: Raw materials (Day 1)
   - Stage 2: Components (Day 15)
   - Stage 3: Finished assemblies (Day 30)
3. Each stage received separately against same PO
4. Production uses materials as received
5. Track project progress via receiving status
6. Final receipt triggers project completion

**Benefits:**
- Align receiving with production
- Reduce work-in-progress inventory
- Milestone-based payment terms

## Business Rules

### Partial Receiving Rules
✅ Multiple goods receipts can be created against a single PO
✅ Each receipt can include any subset of PO line items
✅ Received quantity accumulates across all receipts for a PO line
✅ System automatically calculates remaining quantities
✅ PO status updates automatically based on receiving progress
✅ Can receive zero quantity on a line (skip in shipment)

### Quantity Validation Rules
✅ Received quantity per line item cannot exceed ordered quantity (by default)
✅ Cannot receive negative quantities
✅ Cumulative received quantity across all receipts validated
✅ Over-receipt requires special approval (configurable)
✅ Under-receipt allowed with variance reason required
✅ Zero quantity line items marked as "Not in this shipment"

### Status Transition Rules
✅ Submitted → PartiallyReceived (when first receipt posted)
✅ PartiallyReceived → Received (when all items fully received)
✅ PartiallyReceived → PartiallyReceived (ongoing receipts)
✅ Cannot create receipts against Cancelled POs
✅ Can continue receiving against PartiallyReceived POs
✅ PO automatically closes when fully received (configurable)

### Variance Management Rules
✅ Variance calculated per shipment: Ordered - Received
✅ Positive variance = Short shipment (less than expected)
✅ Negative variance = Over shipment (more than expected)
✅ Significant variance (>10%) requires mandatory reason
✅ Variance tracked at line item level per receipt
✅ Cumulative variance reported across all receipts

### Receipt Cancellation Rules
✅ Can cancel receipts that haven't been posted to inventory
✅ Cancelling posted receipt creates reversal transaction
✅ Cancelled receipt reduces cumulative received quantity
✅ PO status recalculated after receipt cancellation
✅ Cannot cancel receipt if PO already closed
✅ Cancellation reason required for audit trail

### Completion Rules
✅ PO considered complete when all line items fully received
✅ Line item complete when ReceivedQuantity >= OrderedQuantity
✅ Can manually close PO with remaining quantities (short close)
✅ Short close requires approval and close reason
✅ Closed POs cannot receive additional goods (without reopening)
✅ System prevents duplicate receiving against closed POs
