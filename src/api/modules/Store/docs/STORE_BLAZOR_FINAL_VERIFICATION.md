## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### API Limitations (Backend Work Required)
1. **CycleCount Endpoints**: Don't exist yet
   - Impact: CycleCount page not implemented
   - Workaround: None
   - Priority: Low

2. **StockLevels Workflow Operations**: Reserve/Allocate/Release endpoints missing
   - Impact: UI buttons exist but don't work
   - Workaround: None
   - Priority: Medium

3. **PickLists Start/Complete/Cancel**: Only Assign operation available
   - Impact: Limited workflow support
   - Workaround: Manual status updates
   - Priority: Medium

4. **PutAwayTasks Start/Complete/Cancel**: Only Assign operation available
   - Impact: Limited workflow support
   - Workaround: Manual status updates
   - Priority: Medium

5. **GoodsReceipts Update/Receive**: Endpoints don't exist
