Used when receiving goods without a formal purchase order (returns, transfers, free samples, etc.)

**Steps:**
1. **Create Receipt**
   ```
   POST /store/goods-receipts
   {
     "receiptNumber": "GR-2025-10-001",
     "warehouseId": "<warehouse-guid>",
     "receivedDate": "2025-10-24T10:30:00Z",
     "notes": "Direct receipt - supplier return"
   }
   Status: "Draft"
   ```

2. **Add Items**
   ```
   POST /store/goods-receipts/{id}/items
   {
     "productId": "<product-guid>",
     "quantityReceived": 50,
     "unitCost": 15.99,
     "lotNumber": "LOT-2025-A",
     "notes": "Good condition"
   }
   Repeat for each product received
   ```

3. **Mark as Received**
   ```
   POST /store/goods-receipts/{id}/mark-received
   {
     "receivedBy": "John Doe"
   }
   Status: "Received"
   Inventory updated automatically
   ```

### Workflow 2: Purchase Order-Based Receiving

Standard workflow for receiving goods against a purchase order

**Steps:**
1. **Get PO Items for Receiving**
   ```
   GET /store/goods-receipts/purchase-order/{poId}/items
   Returns list of PO items with:
   - Product details
   - Quantity ordered
   - Quantity already received
   - Quantity remaining to receive
   ```

2. **Create Receipt Linked to PO**
   ```
   POST /store/goods-receipts
   {
     "receiptNumber": "GR-2025-10-002",
     "purchaseOrderId": "<po-guid>",
     "warehouseId": "<warehouse-guid>",
     "receivedDate": "2025-10-24T14:00:00Z",
     "notes": "Delivery from PO-2025-09-001"
   }
   ```

   }
   System calculates variance: Ordered(100) - Received(95) = -5
   ```

4. **Quality Inspection (Optional)**
   ```
   PUT /store/goods-receipts/{id}/items/{itemId}/inspect
   {
     "qualityStatus": "Passed",
     "inspectedBy": "Jane Smith",

   - PO Status: "Partially Received"
   ```

2. **Second Receipt (Completing Order)**
   ```
   POST /store/goods-receipts
   Create new receipt with new receipt number

   Create receipt normally
   ```

2. **Add Items with Rejections**
   ```
   POST /store/goods-receipts/{id}/items
   {
     "productId": "<product-guid>",
     "quantityOrdered": 100,
     "quantityReceived": 85,
     "quantityRejected": 15,
     "varianceReason": "15 units failed quality inspection - water damage",
     "qualityStatus": "Failed",
     "inspectedBy": "QC Team",
     "notes": "Rejected units segregated for return to supplier"
   }
   Result:
   - Inventory increased by 85 (only good units)
   - 15 units tracked separately for supplier return/credit
   ```

3. **Mark as Received**
   ```
   POST /store/goods-receipts/{id}/mark-received
   Creates:
   - Inventory transaction (+85 good units)
   - Rejected items transaction (15 units) for return processing
   - Supplier notification for credit/replacement
   ```

   }
   Status: "Cancelled"
   Note: Can only cancel Draft or Received status, not Posted
   ```

### Workflow 6: Search and Reporting

Finding and analyzing receipts

**Examples:**

```
POST /store/goods-receipts/search
{
  "warehouseId": "<warehouse-guid>",
  "status": "Received",
  "receivedDateFrom": "2025-10-01",

```

```
POST /store/goods-receipts/search
{
  "receivedBy": "John Doe",
  "receivedDateFrom": "2025-10-24"
}
Returns: All receipts processed by John Doe today
```

## Business Rules

### Receipt Creation Rules
✅ Receipt number must be unique across all receipts
✅ Received date cannot be in the future
✅ Warehouse ID must be valid and active
✅ If PurchaseOrderId provided, PO must exist and not be closed
✅ Receipt starts in "Draft" status
✅ Can create receipt without PO (direct receiving)

### Item Addition Rules
✅ Can only add items to receipts in Draft or Received status
