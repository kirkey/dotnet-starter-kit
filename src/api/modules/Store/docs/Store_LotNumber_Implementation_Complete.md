## API Documentation

### LotNumber Endpoints
```
POST   /store/lotnumbers          - Create lot number (requires Permissions.Store.Create)
PUT    /store/lotnumbers/{id}     - Update lot number (requires Permissions.Store.Update)
DELETE /store/lotnumbers/{id}     - Delete lot number (requires Permissions.Store.Delete)
GET    /store/lotnumbers/{id}     - Get lot number (requires Permissions.Store.View)
POST   /store/lotnumbers/search   - Search lot numbers (requires Permissions.Store.View)
```

---

## Domain Methods Leveraged

The handlers leverage the domain model methods:

```csharp
// Update lot status
lotNumber.UpdateStatus("Quarantine");

// Update quantity (called by inventory transactions)
lotNumber.UpdateQuantity(quantityChange);

// Check expiration status
bool isExpired = lotNumber.IsExpired();

// Check if expiring soon (within N days)
bool expiringSoon = lotNumber.IsExpiringSoon(daysThreshold: 7);
```

All business rules enforced in domain:
- Status must be one of: Active, Expired, Quarantine, Recalled
- ExpirationDate must be after ManufactureDate
- Lot code uniqueness per item

---

## Validation Rules Implemented

**Create:**
- LotCode required, max 100 characters
- ItemId required (non-empty GUID)
- QuantityReceived >= 0
- ExpirationDate > ManufactureDate (when both provided)
- QualityNotes max 1000 characters
- Duplicate lot code check per item

**Update:**
- Id required
- Status must be: Active, Expired, Quarantine, Recalled
- QualityNotes max 1000 characters

---

## Search Capabilities

**LotNumber Search Filters (9 comprehensive filters):**
- By ItemId (exact match)
- By SupplierId (exact match)
- By LotCode (partial match/contains)
- By Status (Active, Expired, Quarantine, Recalled)
- By ExpirationDateFrom (>= filter)
- By ExpirationDateTo (<= filter)
- By ExpiringWithinDays (expiring within N days)
- By IsExpired (true/false filter)
- By MinQuantityRemaining (>= filter)

**Use Cases:**
- **Expiration Management**: Find lots expiring within 7 days
- **Quality Control**: Filter by status (Quarantine, Recalled)
- **FEFO Picking**: Sort by expiration date (oldest first)
- **Inventory Analysis**: Track remaining quantities by lot
- **Traceability**: Search by lot code or supplier
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate expiration reports

---

## Business Value

The LotNumber entity enables:

1. **Product Recalls**: Quickly identify and isolate affected lots
2. **Quality Control**: Track test results and quarantine suspect lots
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Maintain lot-level traceability records
4. **Expiration Management**: Proactive expiry tracking and alerts
5. **FIFO/FEFO Picking**: Automated oldest-first picking strategies
6. **Supplier Traceability**: Link lots to specific suppliers
7. **Waste Reduction**: Use expiring lots before they expire
8. **Audit Trail**: Complete lot lifecycle tracking

---

## Integration Points

**Related Entities:**
- **Item**: Parent entity (1:N relationship) - lots belong to items
- **Supplier**: Optional supplier tracking (1:N relationship)
- **StockLevel**: Links to lots for location tracking
- **InventoryTransaction**: Records lot-specific movements
- **GoodsReceipt**: Creates lot numbers when receiving goods
- **PickList**: Uses lot numbers for FEFO picking
- **SerialNumber**: Can be combined with lot tracking

---

## Use Case Examples

### Create Lot Number
```http
POST /api/v1/store/lotnumbers
{
  "lotCode": "LOT-2025-001",
  "itemId": "...",
  "quantityReceived": 1000,
  "supplierId": "...",
  "manufactureDate": "2025-09-01",
  "expirationDate": "2026-09-01",
  "qualityNotes": "All quality tests passed"
}
```

### Search Expiring Lots
```http
POST /api/v1/store/lotnumbers/search
{
  "expiringWithinDays": 7,
  "status": "Active",
  "minQuantityRemaining": 1,
  "pageNumber": 1,
  "pageSize": 20,
  "orderBy": "ExpirationDate"
}

Returns lots expiring in next 7 days, oldest first (FEFO)
```

### Quarantine Lot
```http
PUT /api/v1/store/lotnumbers/{id}
{
  "id": "...",
  "status": "Quarantine",
  "qualityNotes": "Failed quality inspection - batch 123"
}
```

### Find Recalled Lots by Supplier
```http
POST /api/v1/store/lotnumbers/search
{
  "supplierId": "...",
  "status": "Recalled",
  "pageNumber": 1,
  "pageSize": 50
}
```

---

## FEFO (First Expired, First Out) Support

The SearchLotNumbersSpec supports FEFO picking strategies:

```csharp
// Order by expiration date (oldest first)
var request = new SearchLotNumbersRequest
{
    ItemId = itemId,
    Status = "Active",
    MinQuantityRemaining = 1,
    OrderBy = "ExpirationDate",
    PageNumber = 1,
    PageSize = 10
};

// Returns lots in FEFO order for picking
```

---

## Expiration Monitoring

**Domain Methods for Expiration:**
```csharp
// Check if expired
if (lotNumber.IsExpired())
{
    lotNumber.UpdateStatus("Expired");
}

// Check if expiring soon (default 7 days)
if (lotNumber.IsExpiringSoon(daysThreshold: 7))
{
    // Send alert or prioritize for picking
}
```

**Search for Expiring Lots:**
```csharp
var expiringLotsRequest = new SearchLotNumbersRequest
{
    ExpiringWithinDays = 7,
    Status = "Active",
    MinQuantityRemaining = 1
};
```

---

## Next Steps (Remaining Entities)

### Priority 1: Serial Number Tracking
- **SerialNumber** - Individual unit tracking for high-value items

### Priority 2: Inventory Operations
- **InventoryTransaction** - Comprehensive movement audit trail with Approve operation
- **InventoryReservation** - Detailed reservation management with Release operation

### Priority 3: Warehouse Operations (Aggregate Roots)
- **GoodsReceipt** - Inbound receiving with AddItem/Complete operations
- **PickList** - Outbound picking with AddItem/Complete operations
- **PutAwayTask** - Put-away task management with AddItem/Complete operations
