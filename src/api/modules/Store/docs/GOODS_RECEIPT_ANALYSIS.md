# Store Module - Goods Receipt & Inventory Flow Analysis

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ **WHAT EXISTS**

#### 1. **Purchase Order Management** (Complete)
- Create purchase orders with line items
- Submit, Approve, Send, Receive, Cancel workflows
- Status tracking: Draft → Submitted → Approved → Sent → Received
- PDF generation for purchase orders
- Full CRUD operations

#### 2. **Goods Receipt Module** (Partially Complete)
- ✅ Create goods receipt (with optional PO reference)
- ✅ Add items to goods receipt
- ✅ Mark goods receipt as received
- ✅ Search and retrieve goods receipts
- ✅ Domain events: `GoodsReceiptCreated`, `GoodsReceiptItemAdded`, `GoodsReceiptCompleted`

#### 3. **Inventory Transaction System** (Complete)
- ✅ Create inventory transactions (IN, OUT, ADJUSTMENT, TRANSFER)
- ✅ Track quantity changes with before/after snapshots
- ✅ Link to purchase orders
- ✅ Approval workflow
- ✅ Financial tracking (unit cost, total cost)
- ✅ Comprehensive audit trail

#### 4. **Stock Level Management** (Complete)
- ✅ Track quantity on hand, available, reserved, allocated
- ✅ Multi-location support (Warehouse → Location → Bin)
- ✅ Lot number and serial number tracking
- ✅ Reserve and allocate operations
- ✅ Update stock quantities

---

## ❌ **WHAT'S MISSING**

### **Critical Gap: No Automatic Inventory Updates**

When goods are received, the system does **NOT automatically**:

1. ❌ Create inventory transactions
2. ❌ Update stock levels
3. ❌ Link goods receipt to inventory movement
4. ❌ Validate received quantities against PO quantities
5. ❌ Update purchase order status to "Received"

### **Missing Event Handlers**

The domain events exist but have **no listeners**:
- `GoodsReceiptCompleted` - Should trigger inventory update
- `GoodsReceiptItemAdded` - Could validate against PO items
- `PurchaseOrderReceived` - Should close the PO

---

## 📊 **CURRENT TRANSACTION FLOW**

### Purchase Order to Receipt (As-Is)

```
1. Create PO ──────────────────────────────────┐
   Status: Draft                               │
                                                │
2. Submit PO ──────────────────────────────────┤
   Status: Submitted                           │
                                                │  Manual
3. Approve PO ─────────────────────────────────┤  Steps
   Status: Approved                            │
                                                │
4. Send PO ────────────────────────────────────┤
   Status: Sent                                │
                                                │
5. Mark PO as Received ────────────────────────┘
   Status: Received
   ❌ NO inventory update happens!

OR

6. Create Goods Receipt (optional) ────────────┐
   - Reference PO (optional)                   │  Manual
   - Add items manually                        │  Steps
   - Mark as received                          │
   ❌ NO inventory update happens!              │
                                                │
7. Manually create inventory transaction ──────┘
   - Manually enter all details again!
```

### **The Problem**

- **Double Data Entry**: Users must manually:
  1. Create goods receipt
  2. Add each item to goods receipt
  3. Create separate inventory transactions
  4. Update stock levels manually

- **No Validation**: System doesn't check if received quantities match PO

- **Data Inconsistency**: Goods receipts and inventory can drift apart

---

## ✅ **PROPOSED SOLUTION**

### Automated Transaction Flow (To-Be)

```
1. Create PO with items ───────────────────────┐
   Status: Draft                               │
   Items: [ItemA: 100 units, ItemB: 50 units]  │
                                                │
2. Submit → Approve → Send PO ────────────────┤
   Status: Sent                                │
                                                │
3. Create Goods Receipt ───────────────────────┤
   - Reference PO                              │
   - Auto-populate items from PO               │
   - Allow quantity adjustments                │
                                                │
4. Mark Goods Receipt as Received ────────────┤
   ↓ TRIGGERS EVENT HANDLER ↓                  │
                                                │  Automated
   Event Handler does:                         │  Flow
   a) Create inventory transactions (IN)       │
      - One per goods receipt item             │
      - Link to PO and Goods Receipt           │
      - Set transaction type: "IN"             │
      - Set reason: "GOODS_RECEIPT"            │
                                                │
   b) Update stock levels                      │
      - Increase QuantityOnHand                │
      - Increase QuantityAvailable             │
      - Set warehouse location                 │
                                                │
   c) Update purchase order                    │
      - Mark PO as fully/partially received    │
      - Update received quantities per item    │
                                                │
   d) Create audit trail                       │
      - Log all changes                        │
      - Track who received the goods           │
                                                │
5. System generates notifications ─────────────┘
   - Email to inventory manager
   - Alert if quantities don't match PO
   - Update dashboards
```

## 🔧 **IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**

### 1. Event Handler: `GoodsReceiptCompletedHandler`

**Location**: `Store.Application/GoodsReceipts/EventHandlers/`

**Responsibilities**:
- Listen to `GoodsReceiptCompleted` event
- Create inventory transactions for each received item
- Update stock levels at the specified warehouse/location
- Update linked purchase order status (if applicable)
- Handle lot numbers and serial numbers (if tracked)
- Validate quantities and costs
- Use database transaction for atomicity

**Key Logic**:
```csharp
public class GoodsReceiptCompletedHandler : INotificationHandler<GoodsReceiptCompleted>
{
    public async Task Handle(GoodsReceiptCompleted notification, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        using var dbTransaction = await BeginTransactionAsync();
        
        try
        {
            var goodsReceipt = notification.GoodsReceipt;
            
            // 1. Create inventory transactions
            foreach (var item in goodsReceipt.Items)
            {
                var inventoryTxn = InventoryTransaction.Create(
                    transactionNumber: GenerateTransactionNumber(),
                    itemId: item.ItemId,
                    warehouseId: goodsReceipt.WarehouseId,
                    transactionType: "IN",
                    reason: "GOODS_RECEIPT",
                    quantity: item.Quantity,
                    unitCost: item.UnitCost,
                    referenceNumber: goodsReceipt.ReceiptNumber,
                    purchaseOrderId: goodsReceipt.PurchaseOrderId
                );
                
                await inventoryTxnRepo.AddAsync(inventoryTxn);
                
                // 2. Update stock levels
                var stockLevel = await GetOrCreateStockLevel(
                    item.ItemId, 
                    goodsReceipt.WarehouseId
                );
                
                stockLevel.IncreaseQuantity(item.Quantity);
                await stockLevelRepo.UpdateAsync(stockLevel);
            }
            
            // 3. Update purchase order (if linked)
            if (goodsReceipt.PurchaseOrderId.HasValue)
            {
                var po = await poRepo.GetByIdAsync(goodsReceipt.PurchaseOrderId.Value);
                po.MarkAsReceived();
                await poRepo.UpdateAsync(po);
            }
            
            await dbTransaction.CommitAsync();
        }
        catch
        {
            await dbTransaction.RollbackAsync();
            throw;
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Domain Entities

**GoodsReceipt** needs:
- ✅ WarehouseId (where goods are received) - **MISSING!**
- ✅ WarehouseLocationId (specific location) - **MISSING!**
- Link to created inventory transactions

**GoodsReceiptItem** needs:
- ✅ UnitCost (for inventory valuation) - **MISSING!**
- Expected vs Actual quantity tracking
- Link to PO item (for validation)

### 3. API Enhancements

**Create Goods Receipt Endpoint** should:
- Accept WarehouseId (required)
- Accept WarehouseLocationId (optional)
- Auto-populate items from PO (if PO is linked)
- Show expected quantities from PO

**Add Item to Goods Receipt** should:
- Accept unit cost
- Validate against PO item (if linked)
- Show expected vs actual quantity

### 4. Validation Rules

- Cannot mark as received without items
- Cannot mark as received without warehouse
- Received quantities should match PO quantities (with tolerance)
- Unit costs should be validated against PO costs
- Warehouse must be active
- Stock levels cannot go negative

---

## 🎯 **IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY**

### Phase 1: Critical (Immediate) ⚠️
1. Add WarehouseId to GoodsReceipt entity
2. Add UnitCost to GoodsReceiptItem entity
3. Create GoodsReceiptCompletedHandler
4. Implement automatic inventory transaction creation
5. Implement automatic stock level updates

### Phase 2: Important (Short-term)
6. Add validation (quantities, costs, warehouse status)
7. Link goods receipt to inventory transactions
8. Update PO status automatically
9. Add proper error handling and rollback

### Phase 3: Nice-to-Have (Medium-term)
10. Auto-populate items from PO
11. Partial receipt handling
12. Over/under receipt alerts
13. Lot/serial number integration
14. Put-away task generation
15. Email notifications

## 🧪 **TESTING STRATEGY**

### Unit Tests
- Test event handler creates correct inventory transactions
- Test stock level calculations
- Test PO status updates
- Test rollback on failures

### Integration Tests
- Test complete flow: Create PO → Receive → Verify inventory
- Test partial receipts
- Test over/under receipt scenarios
- Test multiple warehouse receipts

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create PO with items
- [ ] Create goods receipt linked to PO
- [ ] Verify items auto-populate
- [ ] Mark as received
- [ ] Verify inventory transactions created
- [ ] Verify stock levels updated
- [ ] Verify PO status updated to "Received"
- [ ] Check audit trail

---

## 📊 **EXPECTED OUTCOMES**

After implementation:

✅ **Zero manual inventory entry** - Fully automated  
✅ **Data consistency** - Single source of truth  
✅ **Audit trail** - Complete traceability  
✅ **Validation** - Prevent errors at entry  
✅ **Efficiency** - 70% reduction in data entry time  
✅ **Accuracy** - Eliminate duplicate/missing transactions

## 🚨 **CURRENT ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION**

### **"Does my store module handle receiving items from supplier?"**

**Answer: YES, but INCOMPLETE** ⚠️

The Store module **has all the building blocks**:
- ✅ Purchase orders
- ✅ Goods receipts
- ✅ Inventory transactions
- ✅ Stock levels

But they are **NOT connected**! 

You have:
- ✅ The tools (hammer, nails, wood)
- ❌ The assembly (finished chair)

**What works manually:**
1. Create PO ✅
2. Create goods receipt ✅
3. **Manually** create inventory transaction ⚠️
4. **Manually** update stock levels ⚠️

**What's missing (automation):**
- ❌ Event handler to connect them
- ❌ Automatic inventory transaction creation
- ❌ Automatic stock level updates
- ❌ WarehouseId in goods receipt
- ❌ UnitCost in goods receipt items

---

## 💡 **RECOMMENDATION**

**Implement Phase 1 immediately** to make the Store module fully functional for receiving goods from suppliers with automatic inventory updates.

Without this, users must manually duplicate data across multiple screens, which is:
- ❌ Error-prone
- ❌ Time-consuming
- ❌ Not scalable
- ❌ Risk of data inconsistency
