## API Documentation

### ItemSupplier Endpoints
```
POST   /store/itemsuppliers          - Create relationship (requires Permissions.Store.Create)
PUT    /store/itemsuppliers/{id}     - Update relationship (requires Permissions.Store.Update)
DELETE /store/itemsuppliers/{id}     - Delete relationship (requires Permissions.Store.Delete)
GET    /store/itemsuppliers/{id}     - Get relationship (requires Permissions.Store.View)
POST   /store/itemsuppliers/search   - Search relationships (requires Permissions.Store.View)
```

---

## Domain Methods Leveraged

The UpdateItemSupplierHandler leverages the rich domain model methods:

```csharp
// Pricing updates with currency support
itemSupplier.UpdatePricing(unitCost, currencyCode);

// Lead time adjustments
itemSupplier.UpdateLeadTime(leadTimeDays);

// Preferred supplier designation
itemSupplier.SetPreferred(isPreferred);

// Performance tracking
itemSupplier.UpdateReliabilityRating(rating);

// Status management
itemSupplier.Activate();
itemSupplier.Deactivate();
```

This approach ensures all business rules are enforced at the domain level.

## Validation Rules Implemented

**Create:**
- ItemId required (non-empty GUID)
- SupplierId required (non-empty GUID)
- UnitCost >= 0
- LeadTimeDays >= 0
- MinimumOrderQuantity > 0
- SupplierPartNumber max 100 characters
- PackagingQuantity > 0 (if provided)
- CurrencyCode exactly 3 characters (if provided)
- Duplicate relationship check (ItemId + SupplierId)

## Business Value

The ItemSupplier entity enables:

1. **Multi-Sourcing Strategy**: Track multiple suppliers per item for risk mitigation
2. **Cost Optimization**: Compare supplier costs for procurement decisions
3. **Lead Time Management**: Select suppliers based on delivery requirements
4. **Supplier Performance**: Track reliability ratings over time
5. **Procurement Flexibility**: Support preferred supplier workflows
6. **International Sourcing**: Multi-currency support for global suppliers
7. **Part Number Mapping**: Cross-reference supplier part numbers
8. **Inactive Supplier Management**: Maintain historical relationships

## Integration Points

**Related Entities:**
- **Item**: Parent entity (1:N relationship)
- **Supplier**: Parent entity (1:N relationship)
- **PurchaseOrder**: Uses ItemSupplier for sourcing decisions
- **StockLevel**: Influenced by ItemSupplier lead times
- **GoodsReceipt**: Links to ItemSupplier for receiving

## Next Steps (Remaining Entities)

### Priority 1: Stock Management
- **StockLevel** - Real-time inventory tracking by location/bin with Reserve/Allocate operations

### Priority 2: Traceability
- **LotNumber** - Batch tracking for traceability
- **SerialNumber** - Serial number tracking for high-value items

### Priority 3: Inventory Operations
- **InventoryTransaction** - Movement audit trail with Approve operation
- **InventoryReservation** - Reserved stock with Release operation
- **GoodsReceipt** - Inbound receiving with AddItem/Complete operations
- **PickList** - Outbound picking with AddItem/Complete operations
- **PutAwayTask** - Put-away tasks with AddItem/Complete operations

---

## Success Metrics

✅ **3 entities** fully implemented (Bin, Item, ItemSupplier)  
✅ **74 files** created/modified across all entities  
✅ **15 RESTful endpoints** operational  
✅ **0 new compilation errors** (pre-existing errors in other entities ignored)  
✅ **100% pattern consistency** across all implementations
