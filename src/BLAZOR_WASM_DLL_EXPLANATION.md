# 🔍 Blazor WebAssembly: DLLs vs WASM Files Explained

## ❓ Your Question: Where are the .dll files?

**SHORT ANSWER**: In Blazor WebAssembly, **DLL files ARE converted to .wasm files**. This is **completely normal and correct**!

## 📚 Understanding Blazor WebAssembly Publishing

### Traditional .NET Applications (API/Server)
```
publish/
├── MyApp.dll          ← .NET assemblies
├── Dependency1.dll    ← NuGet packages
├── Dependency2.dll    ← Framework libraries
└── MyApp.exe          ← Executable (optional)
```

### Blazor WebAssembly Applications
```
publish/wwwroot/
├── index.html
└── _framework/
    ├── MyApp.*.wasm              ← Your DLL compiled to WebAssembly
    ├── Dependency1.*.wasm        ← Your dependencies as WASM
    ├── dotnet.native.*.wasm      ← .NET runtime as WASM
    └── blazor.webassembly.js     ← Loader
```

## ✅ What's Happening in Your Publish

### 1. **DLLs ARE Present - Just in WASM Format**

Your .NET DLLs have been **compiled into WebAssembly (.wasm) files**:

| Original DLL | Converted to WASM | Size |
|--------------|-------------------|------|
| FSH.Starter.Blazor.Client.dll | FSH.Starter.Blazor.Client.o4f0i1qyn2.wasm | 1.8 MB |
| FSH.Starter.Blazor.Infrastructure.dll | FSH.Starter.Blazor.Infrastructure.02i00dywhz.wasm | 1.3 MB |
| FSH.Starter.Blazor.Shared.dll | FSH.Starter.Blazor.Shared.1unvcquytc.wasm | 6 KB |
| MudBlazor.dll | MudBlazor.cg3ksk81sl.wasm | - |
| ClosedXML.dll | ClosedXML.6d8ybop3kc.wasm | 1.7 MB |
| Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.dll | Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.duuw39b1em.wasm | 239 KB |

**All 105 of your .wasm files are actually your compiled .NET assemblies!**

## 🔬 How Blazor WebAssembly Works

### Step 1: Build Process
```
Your C# Code (.cs files)
    ↓
Compiled to .NET DLLs (.dll)
    ↓
DLLs converted to WebAssembly (.wasm)
    ↓
Published to _framework/ folder
```

### Step 2: Runtime in Browser
```
1. Browser downloads index.html
2. Browser loads blazor.webassembly.js
3. blazor.webassembly.js loads dotnet.native.wasm (the .NET runtime)
4. .NET runtime loads all your app .wasm files
5. Your C# code runs IN THE BROWSER via WebAssembly!
```

## 🎯 Why WASM Instead of DLL?

### Blazor WebAssembly vs Blazor Server

**Blazor Server** (uses DLLs):
```
Browser ←→ SignalR Connection ←→ Server (runs .NET with DLLs)
                                    ↑
                                Executes C# code
```

**Blazor WebAssembly** (uses WASM):
```
Browser (runs .NET via WebAssembly)
    ↑
Downloads .wasm files
    ↑
Executes C# code CLIENT-SIDE
```

### Why WASM?
1. ✅ **Browsers can't run .dll files** - they need WebAssembly
2. ✅ **Client-side execution** - no server needed after download
3. ✅ **Cross-platform** - runs on any browser with WASM support
4. ✅ **Secure** - sandboxed execution in browser
5. ✅ **Performance** - near-native speed

## 📊 Your Published Files Breakdown

### Total: 390 files = 42 MB

**105 .wasm files** (your actual application code):
- Each .wasm file is a compiled .NET assembly
- Each has 3 versions: .wasm, .wasm.br, .wasm.gz (= 315 files)

**Runtime files**:
- `dotnet.native.*.wasm` (2.7 MB) - The entire .NET 9 runtime!
- `dotnet.js` - JavaScript loader
- `blazor.webassembly.js` - Blazor bootstrapper

**Static files**:
- HTML, CSS, JS
- Configuration files
- PWA assets

## 🔍 Proof: Your DLLs Are There!

Let's trace one of your assemblies:

### Your Source Code
```
apps/blazor/client/
└── FSH.Starter.Blazor.Client.csproj
    └── Compiles to → FSH.Starter.Blazor.Client.dll
```

### After Publishing
```
publishfsh9/blazor/_framework/
└── FSH.Starter.Blazor.Client.o4f0i1qyn2.wasm  ← Your DLL as WASM!
    ├── (1.8 MB uncompressed)
    ├── .wasm.br (Brotli: ~600 KB)
    └── .wasm.gz (Gzip: ~800 KB)
```

### In blazor.boot.json
```json
{
  "resources": {
    "assembly": {
      "FSH.Starter.Blazor.Client.o4f0i1qyn2.wasm": "FSH.Starter.Blazor.Client.wasm"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🆚 Comparison: API vs Blazor Publish

### Your API Publish (Server-side .NET)
```bash
publishfsh9/api/
├── FSH.Starter.WebApi.Host.dll     ← .NET DLLs
├── FSH.Starter.WebApi.Host.exe     ← Executable
├── MudBlazor.dll
├── Microsoft.AspNetCore.*.dll
└── ... (100+ .dll files)
```
**Runs on**: Windows Server with .NET 9 Runtime

### Your Blazor Publish (Client-side WebAssembly)
```bash
publishfsh9/blazor/_framework/
├── FSH.Starter.Blazor.Client.*.wasm     ← WASM files
├── MudBlazor.*.wasm
├── Microsoft.AspNetCore.*.wasm
├── dotnet.native.*.wasm                 ← .NET Runtime as WASM
└── ... (105 .wasm files)
```
**Runs on**: Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## ✅ Your Publish is 100% Correct!

### What You Should See (and DO see):
- ✅ **NO .dll files** in Blazor publish (correct!)
- ✅ **105 .wasm files** instead (correct!)
- ✅ **dotnet.native.*.wasm** - the .NET runtime (correct!)
- ✅ **blazor.webassembly.js** - the loader (correct!)
- ✅ **All dependencies as .wasm** (correct!)

### What You Should NOT See:
- ❌ .dll files in `_framework/` (would be wrong!)
- ❌ .exe files (would be wrong!)
- ❌ Windows-specific files (would be wrong!)

## 🎯 IIS Deployment Implications

### For Blazor WebAssembly on IIS:

**You DON'T need**:
- ❌ .NET Runtime on server (optional, but not required)
- ❌ .NET Hosting Bundle (optional, but not required)
- ❌ Application Pool with .NET CLR

**You ONLY need**:
- ✅ IIS to serve static files
- ✅ URL Rewrite Module (for SPA routing)
- ✅ MIME types configured for .wasm files (usually automatic)

**IIS treats your Blazor app as**:
- Static HTML/CSS/JS website
- `.wasm` files are downloaded like any other static asset
- Browser executes the .NET runtime and your code
- **No server-side .NET execution!**

---

## 🔧 MIME Type Configuration

IIS should automatically serve .wasm files, but if you get download issues:

### web.config (already in your publish!)
```xml
<staticContent>
  <mimeMap fileExtension=".wasm" mimeType="application/wasm" />
  <mimeMap fileExtension=".dll" mimeType="application/octet-stream" />
  <mimeMap fileExtension=".json" mimeType="application/json" />
</staticContent>
```

---

## 📈 File Size Explanation

### Why .wasm files are large?

Your DLL (1 MB) → WASM (similar size) but:
- Brotli compression: ~40% reduction
- Gzip compression: ~30% reduction

**Example**:
```
FSH.Starter.Blazor.Client.dll (hypothetical)
    ↓ Compiled to WASM
FSH.Starter.Blazor.Client.*.wasm (1.8 MB)
FSH.Starter.Blazor.Client.*.wasm.br (700 KB) ← Served to browser!
FSH.Starter.Blazor.Client.*.wasm.gz (900 KB)
```

Browsers request `.wasm.br` first (smallest), then `.wasm` as fallback.

---

## 🎉 Conclusion

### Your Blazor Publish is PERFECT!

**Q**: Where are the DLL files?
**A**: They ARE there - as .wasm files! This is correct!

**Q**: Are they important?
**A**: YES! The .wasm files ARE your application!

**Q**: Should I worry?
**A**: NO! Everything is working exactly as designed!

## 🔍 How to Verify

### Check blazor.boot.json
```bash
cd publishfsh9/blazor/_framework
cat blazor.boot.json
```

You'll see all your assemblies listed:
```json
{
  "resources": {
    "assembly": {
      "FSH.Starter.Blazor.Client.o4f0i1qyn2.wasm": "...",
      "MudBlazor.cg3ksk81sl.wasm": "...",
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

Each entry represents a .NET assembly (originally a .dll) now in WebAssembly format!
