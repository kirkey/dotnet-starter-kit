## Next Steps (Remaining Entities)

### Priority 1: Item Relationships & Tracking
- **ItemSupplier** - Multi-supplier support per item
- **StockLevel** - Real-time stock by warehouse/location/bin
- **LotNumber** - Lot/batch tracking for traceability
- **SerialNumber** - Serial number tracking for high-value items

### Priority 2: Inventory Operations
- **InventoryTransaction** - All inventory movements audit trail
- **InventoryReservation** - Reserved stock for orders/transfers
- **GoodsReceipt** - Inbound receiving operations
- **PickList** - Outbound picking operations
- **PutAwayTask** - Put-away task management

Each entity requires approximately 20-24 files following the established pattern.

## Conclusion

The Bin and Item entities are now production-ready with complete Application layers and RESTful endpoints. Both implementations follow the established architectural patterns and provide comprehensive inventory management capabilities. The Item entity, as the core inventory entity, includes extensive attributes for real-world warehouse management scenarios including multi-location tracking, supplier relationships, perishability management, and serial/lot number support.
