# Accounting Module Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to the Accounting module to ensure all entities and applications follow the coding patterns from the Catalog and Todo projects, implement proper domain events, and include all necessary accounting transaction applications.

## Domain Events Implementation

### 1. Accrual Entity
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Changes Made:**
- Added `QueueDomainEvent(new AccrualCreated(...))` in the Create method
- Added `QueueDomainEvent(new AccrualUpdated(this))` in the Update method
- Added `QueueDomainEvent(new AccrualReversed(...))` in the Reverse method

**Pattern Followed:** Matches Catalog.Product and Todo.TodoItem patterns with domain events

### 2. SecurityDeposit Entity
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Changes Made:**
- Added `using Accounting.Domain.Events.SecurityDeposit;` statement
- Added `QueueDomainEvent(new SecurityDepositCreated(...))` in Create method
- Added `QueueDomainEvent(new SecurityDepositRefunded(...))` in Refund method
- Updated XML documentation references to use correct event names

**Pattern Followed:** Follows immutable entity pattern with proper domain events

### 3. DeferredRevenue Entity
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Changes Made:**
- Added `using Accounting.Domain.Events.DeferredRevenue;` statement
- Added `QueueDomainEvent(new DeferredRevenueCreated(...))` in Create method
- Added `QueueDomainEvent(new DeferredRevenueRecognized(...))` in Recognize method

**Pattern Followed:** Follows revenue recognition pattern with proper lifecycle events

### 4. PatronageCapital Entity
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Changes Made:**
- Added `using Accounting.Domain.Events.PatronageCapital;` statement
- Added `QueueDomainEvent(new PatronageCapitalAllocated(...))` in Create method
- Added conditional `QueueDomainEvent(new PatronageCapitalRetired(...))` or `QueueDomainEvent(new PatronageCapitalPartiallyRetired(...))` in Retire method based on status

**Pattern Followed:** Follows allocation/retirement lifecycle pattern with status-based events

### 5. Invoice Entity
**Status:** ✅ Enhanced

**Changes Made:**
- Added new `InvoiceVoided` event definition
- Added `Void(string? reason)` method to Invoice entity for voiding paid or unpaid invoices
- Method emits `QueueDomainEvent(new InvoiceVoided(...))`

**Pattern Followed:** Separates Cancel (for unpaid) from Void (for any status) following accounting best practices

### 6. Payment Entity
**Status:** ✅ Enhanced

**Changes Made:**
- Added `PaymentRefunded` and `PaymentVoided` event definitions
- Updated existing `Refund` method to emit `QueueDomainEvent(new PaymentRefunded(...))`
- Added new `Void(string? voidReason)` method that clears all allocations and emits `QueueDomainEvent(new PaymentVoided(...))`

**Pattern Followed:** Properly handles refund vs void scenarios with proper allocation management

## Accounting Transaction Applications

All applications follow the CQRS pattern with Command/Handler separation, similar to Catalog and Todo modules.

### 1. Journal Entry Operations
**Path:** `Accounting.Application/JournalEntries/`

**Applications Created:**
- ✅ **Approve/ApproveJournalEntryCommand.cs** - Command to approve a journal entry
- ✅ **Approve/ApproveJournalEntryHandler.cs** - Handler for journal entry approval with proper validation
- ✅ **Reject/RejectJournalEntryCommand.cs** - Command to reject a journal entry with optional reason
- ✅ **Reject/RejectJournalEntryHandler.cs** - Handler for journal entry rejection

**Business Logic:**
- Validates journal entry exists before approval/rejection
- Requires approver/rejector name
- Prevents duplicate approval/rejection
- Emits domain events for audit trail

### 2. Invoice Operations
**Path:** `Accounting.Application/Invoices/`

**Applications Created:**
- ✅ **Cancel/CancelInvoiceCommand.cs** - Command to cancel an unpaid invoice
- ✅ **Cancel/CancelInvoiceHandler.cs** - Handler for invoice cancellation with optional reason
- ✅ **Void/VoidInvoiceCommand.cs** - Command to void an invoice (paid or unpaid)
- ✅ **Void/VoidInvoiceHandler.cs** - Handler for invoice voiding with audit trail

**Business Logic:**
- Cancel is for unpaid invoices only
- Void can handle any invoice status (maintains audit trail)
- Both operations emit appropriate domain events
- Reasons are optional but logged for audit purposes

### 3. Payment Operations
**Path:** `Accounting.Application/Payments/`

**Applications Created:**
- ✅ **Refund/RefundPaymentCommand.cs** - Command to refund a payment amount
- ✅ **Refund/RefundPaymentHandler.cs** - Handler for payment refunds with amount validation
- ✅ **Void/VoidPaymentCommand.cs** - Command to void an entire payment transaction
- ✅ **Void/VoidPaymentHandler.cs** - Handler for payment voiding with allocation clearing

**Business Logic:**
- Refund validates amount doesn't exceed unallocated balance
- Void clears all allocations and emits proper events
- Both operations maintain audit trail with reasons
- Proper event emission for downstream processing

### 4. Fixed Asset Operations
**Path:** `Accounting.Application/FixedAssets/`

**Applications Created:**
- ✅ **Depreciate/DepreciateFixedAssetCommand.cs** - Command to record asset depreciation
- ✅ **Depreciate/DepreciateFixedAssetHandler.cs** - Handler for depreciation calculation and recording

**Business Logic:**
- Validates positive depreciation amount
- Supports multiple depreciation methods
- Updates current book value automatically
- Emits depreciation events for GL posting

### 5. Budget Operations
**Path:** `Accounting.Application/Budgets/`

**Applications Created:**
- ✅ **Approve/ApproveBudgetCommand.cs** - Command to approve a budget
- ✅ **Approve/ApproveBudgetHandler.cs** - Handler for budget approval with validator
- ✅ **Close/CloseBudgetCommand.cs** - Command to close an active budget
- ✅ **Close/CloseBudgetHandler.cs** - Handler for budget closing

**Business Logic:**
- Approve requires non-empty budget with details
- Records approver and approval timestamp
- Close transitions Active budgets to Closed status
- Proper status lifecycle management

### 6. Deferred Revenue Operations
**Path:** `Accounting.Application/DeferredRevenues/`

**Applications Created:**
- ✅ **Recognize/RecognizeDeferredRevenueCommand.cs** - Command to recognize deferred revenue
- ✅ **Recognize/RecognizeDeferredRevenueHandler.cs** - Handler for revenue recognition

**Business Logic:**
- Validates revenue hasn't already been recognized
- Records recognition date for compliance
- Emits event for GL posting and revenue tracking
- Supports revenue recognition principle (ASC 606/IFRS 15)

## Coding Patterns Followed

### 1. Domain Entity Pattern
All entities follow these patterns from Catalog/Todo:
- Private parameterless constructor for EF Core
- Private constructor with validation for domain rules
- Public static `Create` method as factory
- `Update` method that returns the entity for fluent chaining
- Proper `QueueDomainEvent` calls for all state changes
- Implements `AuditableEntity` and `IAggregateRoot`

### 2. Command/Handler Pattern
All applications follow CQRS pattern:
```csharp
// Command - sealed record with IRequest<TResponse>
public sealed record CommandName(...) : IRequest<TResponse>;

// Handler - sealed class with proper dependencies
public sealed class CommandHandler(
    ILogger<CommandHandler> logger,
    [FromKeyedServices("key")] IRepository<T> repository)
    : IRequestHandler<CommandName, TResponse>
{
    // Implementation with validation and domain method calls
}
```

### 3. Event Pattern
All domain events follow:
```csharp
public record EventName(...) : DomainEvent;
```

### 4. Exception Handling
- Uses proper `NotFoundException` for missing entities
- Uses `ArgumentException` for validation failures
- Uses domain-specific exceptions where applicable
- All exceptions are logged appropriately

## Summary Statistics

### Domain Events Added/Fixed
- 3 entities completely updated (Accrual, SecurityDeposit, PatronageCapital)
- 1 entity enhanced with new event (DeferredRevenue)
- 2 entities enhanced with additional events (Invoice, Payment)
- **Total:** 6 entities improved

### Applications Created
- Journal Entry: 2 operations (Approve, Reject) = 4 files
- Invoice: 2 operations (Cancel, Void) = 4 files
- Payment: 2 operations (Refund, Void) = 4 files
- Fixed Asset: 1 operation (Depreciate) = 2 files
- Budget: 2 operations (Approve, Close) = 4 files
- Deferred Revenue: 1 operation (Recognize) = 2 files
- **Total:** 20 new application files

### Event Definitions Added/Updated
- InvoiceVoided event
- PaymentRefunded event
- PaymentVoided event
- **Total:** 3 new events

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency:** All entities and applications now follow the same coding patterns as Catalog and Todo modules
2. **Auditability:** Proper domain events enable complete audit trails for all transactions
3. **Completeness:** All critical accounting transaction operations now have dedicated applications
4. **Maintainability:** Consistent patterns make the codebase easier to understand and maintain
5. **Best Practices:** Follows DDD, CQRS, and accounting best practices throughout

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Account Reconciliation:** Implement full reconciliation workflow if not yet complete
2. **Trial Balance Reporting:** Add query applications for trial balance generation
3. **Financial Statements:** Implement balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow queries
4. **Event Handlers:** Add domain event handlers for automatic GL posting and notifications
5. **Integration Tests:** Add comprehensive tests for all new transaction applications

## Notes

- All implementations maintain backward compatibility with existing code
- Domain events can be consumed by event handlers for downstream processing
- Applications use dependency injection with keyed services following framework patterns
- Logging is implemented consistently across all handlers
- Validation follows domain-driven design principles with rich domain models
