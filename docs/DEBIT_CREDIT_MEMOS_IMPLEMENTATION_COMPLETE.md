## Navigation Menu Integration

Both pages have been added to the Accounting section of the navigation menu:

```csharp
new MenuSectionSubItemModel 
{ 
    Title = "Debit Memos", 
    Icon = Icons.Material.Filled.AddCircleOutline, 
    Href = "/accounting/debit-memos", 
    Action = FshActions.View, 
    Resource = FshResources.Accounting 
},
new MenuSectionSubItemModel 
{ 
    Title = "Credit Memos", 
    Icon = Icons.Material.Filled.RemoveCircleOutline, 
    Href = "/accounting/credit-memos", 
    Action = FshActions.View, 
    Resource = FshResources.Accounting 
}
```

**Icons:**
- Debit Memos: `AddCircleOutline` (indicates adding/increasing balance)
- Credit Memos: `RemoveCircleOutline` (indicates reducing/decreasing balance)

**Routes:**
- Debit Memos: `/accounting/debit-memos`
- Credit Memos: `/accounting/credit-memos`

## API Endpoints Required

### Debit Memos
The following API endpoints need to be implemented or verified:

**CRUD Operations:**

- `GET /api/debit-memos/{id}` - Get debit memo details
- `POST /api/debit-memos` - Create new debit memo
- `PUT /api/debit-memos/{id}` - Update debit memo

## Workflow Examples

### Debit Memo Workflow
1. **Create** - User creates a debit memo in Draft status
2. **Approve** - Manager approves the memo (changes to Approved status)
3. **Apply** - User applies memo to one or more invoices/bills
4. **Complete** - When fully applied, status changes to Applied
5. **Void (Optional)** - If needed, memo can be voided (reverses applications)

### Credit Memo Workflow
1. **Create** - User creates a credit memo in Draft status
2. **Approve** - Manager approves the memo (changes to Approved status)
3. **Apply or Refund**:
   - Apply to invoices/bills to reduce balance
   - Issue direct refund to customer/vendor
   - Can do both (partial apply, partial refund)
4. **Complete** - When fully applied/refunded, status changes to Applied or Refunded
5. **Void (Optional)** - If needed, memo can be voided (reverses all transactions)

## Business Rules

### Common Rules (Both Debit & Credit)
- Memos start in Draft status with Pending approval
- Only Draft memos can be edited or deleted
- Approval required before applying or refunding
- Cannot modify memos after approval (use void instead)

## Code Consistency

Both implementations follow the established pattern from Check Management:

### Architecture
- **ViewModel** - Matches response and command structures
- **Razor** - Uses EntityTable with AdvancedSearchContent, ActionsContent, EditFormContent, ExtraBodyContent
- **Code-Behind** - EntityServerTableContext configuration with specialized operations

### UI Components
- MudBlazor components throughout
- Color-coded status badges
- Currency formatting for amounts
- Context-sensitive action menus
- Modal dialogs for operations
- Proper validation and error handling

### Best Practices
- Separation of concerns (view model, UI, logic)
- Reusable EntityTable component
- Mapster for object mapping
- Snackbar notifications
- Async/await for API calls
- Try-catch error handling
- Clear user feedback

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Batch Operations** - Approve/void multiple memos at once
2. **Export to Excel** - Export memo lists
3. **Email Notifications** - Send notifications on approval/application
4. **Attachment Support** - Attach supporting documents to memos
5. **Comments/Notes** - Add threaded comments for collaboration
6. **Approval Workflow** - Multi-level approval process
7. **Recurring Memos** - Template for regular adjustments
8. **Analytics Dashboard** - Visualize memo trends and balances
9. **Integration** - Link to GL transactions
10. **Printing** - Print memo documents

### Performance Optimizations
- Implement server-side pagination
